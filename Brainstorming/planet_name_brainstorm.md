# Planet Name Brainstorm

Candidate naming options for the key worlds in the project, with quick hooks to anchor tone and imagery.

## Home Origin Planet (Tandris)
- **Resonara** — evokes the glassleaf dunes that sing in high winds.
- **Aurelune** — nods to the long amber twilight cycles under Heliora's light.
- **Tandris** — honors the central continent while sounding stately and old-world.
- **Selenforte** — blends the Selen Basin landmark with musical vigor.
- **Glasshaven** — stresses the domed habitats and glowing succulent architecture.

## Black Hole Enclave Worlds

### Temperate Diplomatic Hub (biosphere anchored in the disk's calm zone)
- **Verdigrad** — “green stronghold” hinting at negotiated neutrality.
- **Auric Accord** — golden light motif paired with perpetual treaty summits.
- **Concord Halo** — suggests orbiting councils suspended in luminous haze.

### Magnetic Foundry World (industrial rail emplacements in hard vacuum)
- **Ferrum Vale** — iron-forward, grounded, pragmatic.
- **Dragforge** — riffs on frame-dragging and relentless production lines.
- **Anvilwake** — conveys sparks trailing through the accretion wake.

### Ice Harvest & Logistics World (outer orbit capturing cometary volatiles)
- **Crysolace** — “cold comfort” for refueling caravans between runs.
- **Glacielle** — graceful yet glacial, matching the slow orbital tempo.
- **Perryhelion** — playful twist on perihelion, noting recurring close passes.

### Pilgrim Sanctuary (refugee rites, cultural preservation)
- **Mnemonic Reach** — memories stretched across relativistic time.
- **Chorazin** — choir-like resonance with vigil traditions.
- **Havenfall** — safe descent point against the black hole’s pull.

## Verdentis (living lattice architecture)
- **Luminara** — bright, airy, suffused with auroral light.
- **Canopyre** — canopy + pyre; trees that flare with bioluminescence.
- **Arborial** — stately, almost hymn-like for the hybrid forests.
- **Sylphforge** — airy spirits entwined with engineered growth.
- **Verdentis** — blends verdant with artesian springs powering the terraces.

## Post-Transit Destination (if a new realm awaits)
- **Chronicle** — a world that becomes the record of the crossing.
- **Eidolon** — mysterious, suggestive of myth made real.
- **Second Helix** — signifies a spiral evolution of humanity.
- **Auroraline** — implies unending dawn on the far side.
