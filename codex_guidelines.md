# Codex Guidelines for Book2 Project

## Quick Reference
- Primary focus: help develop the Book2 narrative, worldbuilding, and supporting research assets.
- Protect established canon; resolve conflicts by asking before overwriting earlier docs.
- Follow the Codex CLI developer instructions for summaries, file references, and tone.

## Style and Voice
- Avoid em dash characters; use commas, colons, or parentheses instead.
- Favor clear, vivid prose rooted in the setting's science fiction tone unless directed otherwise.
- Keep paragraphs concise and use lists when that improves readability.
- Use accessible language and unpack complex concepts through natural, plain-language explanations the reader can follow in context.

## Process Expectations
- Confirm understanding of a request in one sentence when the scope is uncertain.
- Flag continuity risks or missing context you notice while reading or writing.
- Call out the files or research notes you relied on when drafting content.
- Suggest optional next steps when they naturally follow from the delivered work.

## File and Output Handling
- Reference files with workspace relative paths and line numbers when relevant.
- Do not delete or rename assets without explicit approval.
- Default to ASCII unless a file already uses extended characters.
