# Science Fiction Novel - Project Overview

## Genre & Style
- **Type**: Semi-hard sci-fi space opera
- **Tone**: Epic adventures
- **NOT**: Cyberpunk, dystopian
- **Setting**: Far future, long after conventional stars have burned out; anchored on the fading refuge of Tandris and the enigmatic Verdentis near the Kerr Gateway.

## Core Premise

Humanity, driven from the dimming Tandris system, now survives by siphoning energy from ancient black holes. One particular Kerr black hole—ringed by a rare chain of habitable worlds such as Verdentis skimming its accretion disk—is spinning at precisely the rate theorists once predicted could permit a traversal through its ring singularity. Reaching it becomes both a bid for survival and a chance to discover whether the singularity truly offers passage to somewhere new.

### Key Elements
- **Alien encounters**: TBD (potentially included)
- **Time travel**: Probably some element of this
- **Central conflicts**:
  - The debate and uncertainty about whether the transit is actually possible
  - Tensions between the refugee fleets and the entrenched powers on the black hole's inhabited worlds
- **Story focus**: The exodus from the dying world of Tandris, the political and scientific struggle to claim the black hole gateway, and ultimately the attempt to traverse it

## Story Structure (Broad Strokes)

**Beginning → Middle**:
- Flight from Tandris's failing sun toward the black hole enclave and Verdentis
- Scientific and political conflict about feasibility
- Navigating the fractured societies orbiting the accretion disk
- Mission preparation amid interplanetary tensions

**Climax**:
- The actual journey through the singularity

**Conclusion**:
- What they find on the other side, and whether the black hole worlds survive their own rivalries

## Character Development
- Characters not yet fully developed
- Need to brainstorm and build these out

## Next Steps
1. Brainstorm cool ideas based on the black hole premise
2. Create a super basic outline to build upon
3. Later: Develop detailed characters, chapters, and scenes
