# Novel Outline - Basic Structure

## LOCKED PARAMETERS ✓

**The Black Hole**: Supermassive Kerr black hole (~50-100 million solar masses), near-maximum spin, naturally occurring. First discovered candidate that meets criteria for theoretical safe passage.

**The Mission**: One-way journey into silence. Crew assumes no return and no communication once inside event horizon. Time dilation means everyone they know will be aged/dead regardless.

**The Unknown**: What's on the other side? Crew doesn't know. (See other_side_options.md for possibilities)

## ACT I: THE DISCOVERY & THE DEBATE
**Core Question: Should we attempt this?**

### The Discovery
- Humanity detects/discovers the Kerr black hole
- Initial observations reveal its unusual properties
- The theory emerges: we could fly through the ring singularity

### The Divide
- Scientific community splits: believers vs skeptics
- Political/social debate about attempting it
- Failed probe missions create doubt and conflict
- Decision is made: build the ship, recruit the crew

### The Preparation
- Introduce main characters and why they join
- Ship construction and technical challenges
- Personal stakes: families, relationships, sacrifices
- Mounting tension as launch approaches
- Opposition intensifies

## ACT II: THE JOURNEY
**Core Question: Can we actually do this?**

### Departure
- Final goodbyes to Earth/humanity
- Journey to the black hole
- Crew dynamics: conflicts, alliances, doubts emerge
- Scientific measurements as they approach
- The reality of what they're attempting sets in

### Approach to the Event Horizon
- **Time dilation effects become severe**:
  - Crew sends messages, responses come back months/years later
  - Watching loved ones age in real-time via delayed transmissions
  - Children growing up, parents dying, world changing
  - The emotional weight: every hour for them = years for everyone else
- **Last communications with humanity** (knowing years are passing back home)
  - Final messages knowing no response is possible before the crossing
  - What do you say when it's truly goodbye forever?
  - Some crew members receive messages from people now dead
- **Technical problems or sabotage?**
  - Systems strain under extreme gravitational stress
  - Is it malfunction or deliberate interference?
- **The Cauchy Horizon Problem**:
  - Approaching the inner event horizon
  - Instruments detect the blue-shifted radiation wall
  - This is the REAL point of no return
  - Crew members must confront their doubts and make final decision
- **Final preparations for the crossing**
  - Setting trajectory for perfect threading through ring singularity
  - Navigation requires precision beyond human capability (AI crucial)
  - Crew straps in, knowing next few hours will change everything

### The Point of No Return
- Crossing the event horizon
- Reality begins to break down
- Inside the ergosphere: space and time behave strangely
- Navigation through the impossible
- The crew faces the ultimate test

## ACT III: THE CROSSING & THE OTHER SIDE
**Core Question: What lies beyond?**

### Through the Singularity
- Threading through the ring singularity
- The moment of transition
- Possible consciousness/reality-altering experiences
- Survival against all odds

### The Other Side
- Emergence into... somewhere else
- First observations: where/when are they?
- The revelation of what the black hole actually connected to
- Understanding the true nature of what they've accomplished

### Resolution
- What this means for the crew
- What this means for humanity (if they can ever tell them)
- The new reality they must face
- Final thematic statement: was it worth it?

## Key Decisions Still To Make

### DECIDED ✓
- ~~Can they communicate back?~~ **NO - One-way trip, no communication from beyond event horizon**
- ~~Type of black hole?~~ **Supermassive Kerr, naturally occurring, near-maximum spin**
- ~~What makes it special?~~ **First discovered that meets criteria; rare combination of mass/spin/stability**

### STILL OPEN ❓

1. **What IS on the other side?** (See other_side_options.md for detailed analysis)
   - Wormhole to another region of space?
   - Time travel (far future/far past)?
   - Another universe entirely?
   - Combination (space + time displacement)?
   - **RECOMMENDED**: Far future + different location (most dramatic + semi-realistic)

2. **Does the crew survive intact?**
   - All survive?
   - Some casualties during transit?
   - Transformed in some way (physical or mental)?
   - Perfect trajectory + quantum effects = survival?

3. **The antagonist/opposition:**
   - Internal (crew member doubts/sabotage)?
   - External (political faction trying to stop mission)?
   - Scientific opposition (those who think it's suicide)?
   - The physics itself (Cauchy horizon, tidal forces)?
   - **SUGGESTION**: Combination - external opposition + internal doubt + the brutal reality of physics

4. **Tone of the ending:**
   - Triumphant discovery (they survived and found something amazing)?
   - Bittersweet sacrifice (survival but at tremendous cost)?
   - Terrifying revelation (they succeeded but what they found is disturbing)?
   - Open-ended mystery (ambiguous outcome)?
   - **THEMATIC CORE**: Was the sacrifice worth it? What does "worth it" even mean when you've left everything behind?

5. **What happens to Earth/Humanity in the story?**
   - Do we see the long-term aftermath on Earth?
   - Does time dilation mean centuries pass during their journey?
   - Is humanity still around by the time they reach their destination?
   - Does the mission succeed in inspiring humanity or divide it?
