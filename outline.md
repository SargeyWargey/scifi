- Opposition intensifies

## ACT II: THE JOURNEY
**Core Question: Can we actually do this?**

### Departure
- Final goodbyes to Earth/humanity
- Journey to the black hole
- Crew dynamics: conflicts, alliances, doubts emerge
- Scientific measurements as they approach
- The reality of what they're attempting sets in

### Approach to the Event Horizon
- Time dilation effects become severe
- Last communications with humanity (knowing years are passing back home)
- Technical problems or sabotage?
- Crew members must confront their doubts
- Final preparations for the crossing

### The Point of No Return
- Crossing the event horizon
- Reality begins to break down
- Inside the ergosphere: space and time behave strangely
- Navigation through the impossible
- The crew faces the ultimate test

## ACT III: THE CROSSING & THE OTHER SIDE
**Core Question: What lies beyond?**

### Through the Singularity
- Threading through the ring singularity
- The moment of transition
- Possible consciousness/reality-altering experiences
- Survival against all odds

### The Other Side
- Emergence into... somewhere else
- First observations: where/when are they?
- The revelation of what the black hole actually connected to

   - Another place in our universe?
   - Something stranger?

2. **Does the crew survive intact?**
   - All survive?
   - Some casualties?
   - Transformed in some way?

3. **Can they communicate back?**
   - One-way trip into silence?
   - Find a way to send a message?
   - Return journey possible?

4. **The antagonist/opposition:**
   - Internal (crew member)?
   - External (faction trying to stop them)?
   - The black hole itself?
   - All of the above?

5. **Tone of the ending:**
   - Triumphant discovery?
   - Bittersweet sacrifice?
   - Terrifying revelation?
   - Open-ended mystery?
