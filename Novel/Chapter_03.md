# Chapter 3 - Clinical Oaths

Elys Kadrin moved along the Mirrored Range clinic corridor with a diagnostic slate in one hand and a tray of bioluminescent cultures in the other. Outside the hospital's curved glass, the morning light fractured into pale gold, refracted by the thin veil of copper motes that had filtered into the dome overnight.

On the slab nearest the triage desk a miner from the Aeolian flats wheezed through a filter mask. The vents above his head rattled, trying to keep up with the influx of particulate-laden air. Elys pressed the tray onto a sterile pedestal, slid a culture chip beneath the mask's intake valve, and watched the color shift from calm teal to warning orange.

That exact shade meant the shield filters above Vorakai were sloughing their protective coating. She logged the result with a flick of her wrist and adjusted the miner's breathing cadence, guiding him through measured inhales. His lungs sounded like parchment rubbed together when her stethoscope touched his ribs.

Technicians hurried between cots carrying portable scrubbers. The Mirrored Range dome had never looked so frayed. Frosted panels along the ceiling showed spider veins where Heliora's last flare had stressed the lattice. Condensation clung to the edges, collecting dust that glittered in the light with deceptive beauty.

Elys coaxed the culture chip back into its slot, then extracted a vial of microfoam. "You will feel a chill," she warned, easing the spray into the miner's throat. The foam expanded, coating irritated bronchi with a medicated film. The man's shoulders eased.

Across the ward, Nurse Tala confirmed another copper-mote case. "Twelve in the first hour," she called. "Gate filters flagged at thirty percent efficiency before dawn."

Elys nodded, refusing to let urgency clutter her tone. "Document every intake. If the numbers keep climbing we escalate to the Council before the noon briefing." She shifted to the next cot.

A young mother sat upright clutching her daughter. The child's chest heaved. Elys knelt to meet the girl's eyes. "I need you to look at this light for me." She tilted the culture tray. The girl's pupils followed the glow even as her breath stuttered.

The analysis slate chimed. Elys skimmed the overlay, tapping through layers of data that mapped copper concentrations against airflow models. Mirrored Range had promised its residents clean air and quiet labs. Today the dome tasted like a forge.

She administered a bronchodilator to the child, recorded the dose, and handed the mother a small canister of filter dusting solution. "Replace your home vents every two hours until the shield crews finish patching. If she spikes a fever you call the medline immediately."

A runner from the outer clinics arrived breathless. "Dr. Kadrin, you are wanted in Consultation Bay Three."

Elys glanced at the runner's pale face and then at the packed triage board. "Urgency?"

"Council-coded. The message said you would want to hear it yourself."

Elys transferred the culture tray to Tala. "Keep the samples chilled. I need a full comparison set by the time I return." She stripped off her gloves, replaced them with a clean pair from her satchel, and made her way toward the consultation bays.

The corridor leading to Bay Three hugged the inner curve of the dome. Through the glass she could see the Mirrored Range cliffs descending into mist. The cliffs wore protective netting to catch cascading ice fragments, yet even there patches had begun to fray. Heliora's light felt sharper than it had a month ago, less filtered, more intrusive.

Elys paused at a hydration kiosk long enough to rinse copper grit from her throat. The water tasted faintly metallic. She swallowed and squared her shoulders. The Council rarely summoned her mid triage unless the request came from someone with influence.

Consultation Bay Three held a single occupant: a man in a polished charcoal suit trimmed with the stylized helix of the Extractionist syndicate. He sat at the central table, hands folded, posture relaxed as if the alarms outside were an orchestral prelude meant for his benefit.

Elys closed the door behind her. "You flagged a Council code to contact me. State your purpose."

The man rose with practiced civility. "Dr. Kadrin, I am Serin Halvek. The Syndicate of Strategic Extraction requested I deliver an offer, given the strain on your facilities." His voice had the smooth cadence of someone used to negotiation chambers.

Elys kept a meter of distance between them. "My staff is treating copper-mote lung flare-ups. If you have supplies to donate, deliver them through the proper intake line."

Serin smiled, a slight upturn that never touched his eyes. "We intend something more refined. Our investors control three shipment pods of Heliora-grade bioscanners. They would fit neatly in your labs. In exchange we ask only that your triage protocols align with the Council's most critical assets."

"Critical assets," Elys repeated. "You mean the investors who purchased convoy guarantees."

He spread his hands as if the term were tautology. "If our leaders fall ill, the exodus falters. Ensuring their well-being ensures the convoy's success. You already ration care during crises. All I propose is a quiet prioritization when symptoms conflict."

Elys felt her jaw set. She pictured the waiting room behind her, the mother with the wheezing child, the miner with lungs scarred by dust. Over Serin's shoulder the bay window framed the Mirrored Range labs. Sunlight traced the outlines of diagnostic pods she could outfit twice over with the equipment he dangled. "Medical prioritization follows severity and survivability. Not wealth."

"Ideals can be expensive," Serin said. He drew a wafer-thin datapad from his coat. The display lit with the schematics of lab instruments Elys had requested for months: a spectrometry array capable of reading bioluminescent cultures in real time, microfabricators for sterile implants, portable med stasis units that could keep a patient stabilized during transit. "Think beyond today. You could diagnose copper-mote lesions before they scar. You could outfit Verdentis expedition kits."

The yearning that flickered through her surprised her, warm and sharp. She imagined the relief of having enough stasis units to treat the evacuees stacked in hallways after a flare. She imagined telling her fathers that their foster clinic would never run short again. The vision tightened her chest before she crushed it.

"You are asking me to violate the Tandris medical oath," she said. "The oath I carry on this bracelet." She touched the thin copper band on her wrist, engraved with the old words. "I do not trade care for favors."

Serin tilted his head. "The oath demands you preserve life. Surely you understand that life includes the architects who will guide us through the Kerr Gateway. We both know the Council values your voice. We could ensure your projects receive additional funding. Imagine the research you could continue once Verdentis is secure."

The invitation carried a ghost of temptation. Elys saw her own reflection in the bay glass, eyes dimmed from too little sleep. She thought of Cael Varik's rough gratitude when she patched him up during cadet drills two years ago, of his promise to protect the med teams in return. She thought of Aurelia, neck hunched over calculations, trusting Elys to keep bodies functional while math saved the fleet. None of them had asked for special triage lanes.

"You may leave," she said. "Take your scanners to the open market if you wish to sell them. My clinic will survive without your bargain."

Serin exhaled through his nose and lifted the datapad again, this time projecting a ledger of names. The columns listed donors, convoy berth assignments, medical flags. Several names glowed in warning red. "Do you think the Council will actually randomize selection? I offer you a chance to control who receives treatment. Decline and you relinquish that control to less scrupulous hands."

Elys stepped closer, reading the red entries. Among them she murmured, "Varik, Liora. Chronic pulmonary scarring." Cael's mother. The pit in her stomach widened. "You already tampered with the lotteries."

He did not confirm or deny. "Walk out there and continue to treat miners until your wrists ache. The syndicate will adjust outcomes elsewhere. Your acceptance could ensure the right families survive."

Elys felt anger flush her cheeks. "The right families are the ones waiting in those cots. You will not use me to launder corruption." She touched the panel to open the door. "Bay Three is for patient care. This meeting is over."

Serin paused beside her. "Councilors whispered that you were pragmatic. Perhaps they misjudged. Or perhaps you will reconsider before the afternoon session. I will keep the crates sealed until then."

He disappeared down the corridor, leaving the faint smell of ozone and charcoal polish. Elys let the door slide shut and leaned against the cool glass. For a moment she allowed herself to imagine the spectrometry array humming in her lab. Then she catalogued the thought as a hazard and moved on.

She recorded a brief log entry summarizing the exchange, tagging it with a private alert to Archivist Anhal. Then she returned to triage, slower this time, as if every step needed reassessment.

The ward had grown louder. A queue of patients stretched past the entrance. Filters along the ceiling shimmered with an unhealthy reddish tinge. Nurse Tala raised her eyebrows, silently asking whether reinforcement was coming.

Elys shook her head. "Not yet. Keep the misting units oscillating. I will rotate between cots and log severity scores." She moved to a set of siblings sharing a breathing mask and split the support, calibrating the flow to match their lung capacity.

As she worked, the offer replayed in the back of her mind. Her fingers moved with muscle memory while her thoughts raced through probability loops. If Serin was right, the lottery algorithms were already compromised. The data-driven lottery she had once sketched remained hypothetical.

She finished the copper-mote round at midday. Sweat gathered at her temples. She washed her hands, noted the tremor in her fingers, and forced it still by curling her palm around a sterilized scalpel handle. Focus. Data first. Emotion later.

A courier delivered a sealed packet marked with the Gatekeeper seal. Inside lay a handwritten note from Sori Anhal requesting a meeting in the archives annex. Elys tucked the note into her satchel along with the bracelet she sometimes wore when she needed extra resolve. She briefed Tala on afternoon duties and left the clinic.

The Mirrored Range archives occupied a quiet level above the clinic, accessible through a spiral walkway lined with etched glass. Each panel held rendered equations that tracked Heliora's flux history. As Elys ascended, she felt her breathing settle. The smell of old paper and ozone replaced the metallic tang of the ward.

Sori Anhal waited beside a circular table cluttered with resonance charts. The Archivist's silver hair was pulled into a low knot, and her fingers tapped an irregular rhythm against a stack of slates. Aurelia's latest calculations lay open nearby, filled with neat annotations.

"You sent the alert," Anhal said without preamble.

Elys nodded. "Extractor emissary. Serin Halvek. He offered equipment in exchange for prioritizing investors during triage. He implied the lottery algorithms are compromised."

Anhal's eyes narrowed. "We suspected as much. Aurelia ran irregularity scans on the lottery output yesterday. The variance skewed toward families with Extractionist donors. We lacked proof."

Elys pulled the datapad copy from her satchel and projected the ledger across the table. "He handed me this list. Red entries indicate medical complications. Liora Varik is there." Her voice tightened on the name.

Anhal studied the projection. "Cael's mother. That explains why he cornered me after the riot asking for a review of the lottery code. He feared the promises were too tidy."

Elys set her palms on the table and leaned forward. "I need a protocol that renders bribery irrelevant. Randomized selection weighted by medical need, survival probability, and duty assignments. Transparent enough that the Council cannot twist it. Strong enough that bribes lose leverage."

Anhal gestured to the slates. "Your previous models came close, but the Council balked at releasing patient data. Concerns about privacy. We could anonymize entries. Use encrypted tags only med corps can decode."

"I also want a visual output," Elys said. "Something the public can read. If citizens can track the lottery draw themselves, extraction networks lose narrative control."

Anhal smiled faintly. "Spoken like someone raised by an archivist." She keyed open a secure channel and summoned a set of archived civic lottery protocols from the first Heliora shelters. "They faced similar manipulation. Their solution used multi-seal verification. Each seal generated three correlated numbers. No single faction could predict the outcome."

Elys scanned the protocol and adapted it on the slate, her fingers flying between lines of code. She layered in data streams from the medical corps: infection rates, copper-mote flare projections, trauma readiness for Defense Corps families.

As she coded, she narrated the logic. "Inputs include age, dependent status, critical skills. Medical conditions add weight but cap out to prevent monopolies. We broadcast anonymized blocks through the Mirrored Range public net, then reveal identities only after medical verification. Any alteration would light up as a checksum error."

Anhal watched a moment, then reached for a stylus and added a note. "I will secure Council charter language that recognizes medical triage ethics as binding. That way anyone who pressures you violates civil law."

Elys paused. "You trust they will honor it?"

Anhal's eyes softened. "I trust you will remind them in public if they do not. Aurelia's projections back your stance. Heliora's flux timeline leaves no room for selective care. Every life we save now strengthens the convoy when we launch."

Elys saved the algorithm, encrypting it with a key shared between the medical corps and the Gatekeepers. She felt the code settle into place, a lattice of logic that steadied her breathing. "I will present this at the council hearing."

Anhal placed a hand lightly over Elys's bracelet. "Remember, Serin and his ilk thrive on secrecy. Shine light on them. Name what they asked you to do. The public will listen if you ground it in data."

Elys closed her fingers around the bracelet. "I intend to. Cael will be in the hearing with his unit. He needs to hear that his mother's health matters without corruption."

Anhal's gaze sharpened, reading the ache Elys tried to hide. "Does his presence steady you or distract you?"

Elys hesitated. Honesty with Anhal had always felt like a diagnostic test she owed herself. "Both. He trusts me when I speak as a physician. He also forgets to see me when the mission ends."

Anhal nodded as if she expected nothing less. "Then speak for the mission. Let the rest settle later."

Elys exhaled. "I have afternoon rounds and then a Council docket. I will send the protocol to the med corps queue."

She left the archives with the algorithm humming in her slate like a quiet engine. Her steps felt steadier, anchored by the plan.

Back in the clinic, the afternoon crowd had thinned to a manageable cadence. The copper-mote emergency had stabilized thanks to recalibrated filters streaming cool air from Verdentis-engineered vents. Elys rotated her shoulders to undo a knot of tension.

A message pinged on her slate: Cadet Cael Varik awaiting clearance per Captain Kadar's order. She felt the message like a pulse beneath her skin. Moments later the medbay door hissed open and Cael limped in, braced knee stiff, uniform scuffed from riot duty.

He offered a salute with the ease of habit. "Doctor. Reporting for examination."

Elys kept her voice neutral. "Sit on the diagnostic platform. Remove the brace slowly. Tell me if the pain spikes."

Cael eased himself onto the platform, teeth clenched as he unclipped the brace. The swelling around his knee had gone down slightly, but the bruising had deepened to a mottled violet. Sweat darkened his collar. He smelled faintly of sun-heated fabric and copper dust.

Elys positioned a med scanner over the joint. Blue light spread across his skin, mapping microtears. "Your ligament is stressed but intact. The foam I applied earlier is holding. However, you ignored the instruction to stay off the joint."

He shrugged, eyes flicking toward the waiting room. "I supervised the cadet debrief before coming here. Kadar insists on showing the feed from the riot to every unit so they understand consequence."

Elys adjusted the scanner's focus. "Your knee does not get stronger when you narrate other people's mistakes. You need rest, compression therapy, and consistent elevation."

Cael's mouth quirked. "If I elevate it now the entire squad will see their lead propped on a cushion while they run drills."

Elys switched to manual inspection, her fingers pressing along the tendon line. She felt the tension in his muscles, the way he held himself ready to bolt even when seated. "You already set an example today. The riot could have turned catastrophic. Your instinct to neutralize the disruptor saved the gate lattice."

He looked away, jaw tight. "Kadar wrote me up for dereliction. My squad learned that heroics earn reprimands."

Elys reached for a vial of anti-inflammatory nanofluid. "Your squad also learned that civilians breathe because you intervened. I was on the other side of that gate treating heatstroke when the lattice flickered. I felt the hum change. If those disruptors had detonated, my patients would have inhaled shards. Or we would have lost the gate entirely."

He met her eyes then, something like gratitude sparking before he banked it. "I know. I saw you through the barrier. That is why I chose to run."

The admission landed with more weight than his earlier salute. Elys injected the nanofluid near the joint, then wrapped the knee in a fresh support band lined with microheaters. Her touch lingered a moment longer than necessary, absorbing the heat of his skin.

"You need to appreciate your body as much as you appreciate your command reports," she said softly. "If you tear this ligament you will miss convoy launch. That means fewer security leads on Verdentis. Fewer physicians protected during transit."

He let out a slow breath. "I hear you. But my mother is in the lottery queue again. She sold heirlooms for a guarantee. If I cannot ensure her place through service, what am I doing? I cannot hand that control to syndicate brokers."

Elys felt the earlier anger resurface. "The syndicate approached me today. They offered lab equipment in exchange for prioritizing investors. Your mother's name was on their roster of debts. They are counting on us to look away."

Cael's hands curled into fists. "Who? Give me the name."

She shook her head. "I logged the interaction with Anhal. We are building a protocol to expose the tampering. You will hear about it at the Council session. For now, you focus on recovery. Let me fight this in the chamber while you heal."

He leaned forward despite the movement tugging his knee. "Why do you carry this alone? We can dismantle the brokers together."

Because I am the one they underestimate, she almost said. Instead she replied, "You have your arena. I have mine. Trust that I will not let them trade lives for profit."

Cael studied her, searching for cracks. After a moment he nodded, slow and deliberate. "If you need security for the hearing, say it."

Elys pressed a compression seal around his brace. "I need you to follow orders for once and arrive on time with the leg elevated. Bring a cane if you must. I will set you up with a med courier to deliver ice packs."

He chuckled, a short sound that eased some of the tension coiled in her chest. "Yes, Doctor." He slid off the platform, testing his weight with caution. "Thank you. For earlier, for now, for whatever you are about to do."

The words brushed close to gratitude but not close enough. Elys swallowed the ache that rose. "Do not undo my work before the hearing."

He moved toward the door, pausing with his hand on the frame. "Elys, we will make sure my mother gets through. All of our families. I promise."

The promise landed like an echo of a hundred others. Once he left, she released the breath she had held since he arrived. She turned to sterilize the instruments, tapping each against the auto-sanitizer as if rhythm could keep her composure intact.

Only when the room emptied did she allow herself to sit on the stool and press the heels of her palms to her eyes. The copper bracelet dug into her skin, grounding her. She whispered the opening line of the Tandris oath into the quiet. "To treat without prejudice, to heal without hierarchy." The words steadied her pulse.

The afternoon sun dipped toward the horizon, tinting Heliora's haze in peach and violet stripes. Elys changed into her formal med corps uniform, cinched her satchel across her body, and made her way toward the Council amphitheater.

Outside the chamber, citizens gathered in restless clusters. Some held placards demanding transparency. Others clutched ration chits, hoping the hearing would protect them. The air tasted of expectation and recycled citrus from vendor stalls that had sprung up to feed the crowd.

Elys spotted Soren Tal near the entrance, and he lifted a hand in greeting before returning to a hushed conversation with a pair of guild engineers. Aurelia was nowhere in sight, likely sequestered in a preparation room with Anhal. Cael stood near the Defense Corps section, cane in hand as instructed, jaw set.

Elys nodded to him once, then passed through security. The amphitheater's interior glowed with soft, diffused light from suspended lumens. Councilors filled the upper tiers, their robes marking faction colors: Gatekeeper blues, Extractor black and gold, Civic green. The chamber floor held rods of singer stone that hummed at a steady frequency, calming the audience at least in theory.

Elys took her place at the central dais reserved for medical testimony. Her slate connected to the chamber's holographic display with a muted chime. The Council Speaker, Meret Glynn, struck the soundboard. "This session convenes to address resource allocation amid escalating copper-mote lung incidents. Dr. Elys Kadrin has requested the floor."

Elys inhaled. The weight of eyes pressing down on her felt more intense than the copper-laden air. She began with data, projecting the triage numbers tallied over the past forty-eight hours. "Mirrored Range clinics treated eighty-four copper-mote cases since dawn. Shield filters failed along Vorakai's western grid at 0300 hours. Current treatments rely on limited microfoam reserves that will not last another flare."

Murmurs rippled through the spectators. Extractor councilor Danel Kye adjusted his collar, gaze calculating. "We have shipments of microfoam ready for dispatch," he said. "However, priority must go to the convoy architects. Without them the rest of this is moot."

Elys stood taller. "With respect, Councilor Kye, copper-mote lesions do not discriminate between architects and algae harvesters. If the miners fall, we lose the workforce maintaining the convoy hulls. If children choke today, there will be fewer adults to crew the fleet tomorrow. Priority must follow medical severity, not wealth."

Another Extractor councilor, Lysa Bren, leaned forward. "Are you implying the Council has ignored severity? The medical corps decides triage already."

Elys tapped her slate, summoning Serin's ledger. She blanked the names to preserve privacy, leaving only the data tags and the red warning indicators. "An Extractor emissary provided me this roster this morning before offering lab equipment in exchange for preferential treatment. Red flags mark families who already secured guaranteed convoy berths through donations. Note the concentration of medical alerts within that donor pool."

A rustle spread through the chamber. Kye's expression darkened. "This is an accusation without proof."

Elys zoomed in on four entries. One contained the tag for Cael's mother, though the audience could not see the name. "Proof lies in the code. The lottery system shows a statistical bias toward these donor tags. I have an algorithm that neutralizes manipulation. It randomizes selection based on anonymized medical data, verifiable by any citizen through public channels. I request that the Council adopt it immediately."

Gatekeeper councilors exchanged glances. Meret Glynn nodded toward Anhal in the gallery; the Archivist lifted a sealed document. "The Gatekeepers have reviewed Dr. Kadrin's protocol. We support its adoption."

Elys continued. "The algorithm ensures that no single faction controls outcomes. It weighs chronic conditions, essential skills, dependent counts, and current contribution to convoy preparation. Medical triage remains under corps authority, but selection lot announces publicly with transparency. Any attempt to tamper will trigger a checksum broadcast visible to every citizen."

Lysa Bren raised a hand. "And if critical investors fall ill while waiting their turn? We risk losing expertise."

Elys fixed her gaze on the councilor. "Expertise is meaningless if the society it intends to lead suffocates. The convoy requires welders, hydroponic techs, archivists, and children who will grow into engineers. Merit is not measured by credits. It is measured by what we contribute and what we choose to protect. Today the copper-mote lung does not care about investor portfolios."

A murmur of approval rose from the public seating. Elys pressed forward. "Furthermore, I propose that every clinic's supply ledger be mirrored to a public server. Citizens will see what we receive and when. Donations will be recorded in open view. If an Extractor syndicate wishes to gift scanners, they will do so without conditions or the public will see the strings immediately."

Kye leaned toward his microphone, voice edged with warning. "You speak boldly for someone whose career depends on Council funding."

Elys lifted her chin. "My career depends on patients who can breathe. Funding is irrelevant if we have no living citizens to treat. The Tandris medical oath binds me to care for all, not the richest few. I stand by that oath."

She touched the copper bracelet. The gesture was subtle, but it drew the attention of several med corps physicians seated nearby. One by one they rose, raising their own copper bands or badges. The motion spread like a wave until half the medical delegation stood in silent support.

Meret Glynn surveyed the chamber. "The proposal is on record. Council members will vote after reviewing the algorithm. In the interim, the medical corps will manage triage without interference. Any attempt to barter for prioritization will result in censure."

Kye opened his mouth to protest, but the public gallery erupted in applause, drowning him out. Citizens stamped their feet, the sound reverberating through the singer stone pillars. Aurelia stepped into view along the upper balcony, eyes bright with fierce pride. Soren stood beside her, hands clasped. Even Cael, cane braced, nodded once. The motion was small yet carried the weight of trust.

Elys released a breath she had not realized she held. Heat washed through her, a blend of adrenaline and relief. She concluded her presentation with a final data slide showing projected survival increases if the algorithm took effect. Numbers anchored the emotion, reminding everyone of the stakes.

After the session, councilors descended into clusters of debate. Reporters from the civic network pressed toward Elys, thrusting recorders close. "Dr. Kadrin, did an Extractor syndicate truly offer bribes?" "Will you name the emissary?" "How soon can clinics implement the public ledger?"

Elys fielded the questions with measured answers. "Yes, they did. The investigation is underway, and names will be released when evidence is secured. Implementation can begin tonight once the med corps uploads supply inventories. Citizens deserve visibility." She kept her tone even, aware that any stutter would be seized upon.

Anhal slipped through the reporters and touched Elys's arm. "The Gatekeepers will help upload the algorithm." She lowered her voice. "You shifted the axis today."

Elys allowed herself a small smile. "The axis needed shifting." She glanced toward the Defense Corps cluster. Cael was bent over his cane, listening to Captain Kadar. When he straightened, their eyes met across the crowd. He tapped his thigh where the support band lay, a silent acknowledgment. She inclined her head, a private exchange stitched in the open.

The amphitheater slowly emptied. Outside, the air had cooled, the copper haze settling closer to the ground. Citizens lingered to discuss the session, their voices electric. Children ran between adults, waving printed copies of the lottery algorithm that Gatekeeper volunteers were already distributing.

Elys walked toward the clinic, fatigue settling into her bones now that the surge of adrenaline faded. A street musician plucked a quiet tune on a resonance harp, the notes vibrating through the pavement like a heartbeat. Someone had hung ribbons along the walkway bearing the words: "Oathkeepers keep us breathing."

As she approached the clinic doors, a courier intercepted her with a small parcel. "From Mirrored Range apprentices," he said. Inside the parcel lay a set of hand-stitched filter masks and a note: "We saw you. Thank you for making the lottery fair."

Elys pressed the masks to her chest for a moment. Behind the glass, the clinic lights glowed warm. Nurse Tala waved from inside, pointing to the newly installed supply ledger already scrolling across a wall display.

Elys stepped back into the ward she had left that morning. The air felt clearer. Not cured, but clearer. She returned to her desk, uploaded the algorithm to the med corps network, and activated the public feed. Data populated the screens, transparent and undeniable.

The night shift arrived. Elys briefed them quickly, emphasizing the new protocol. She scheduled a series of training sessions to teach staff how to monitor the public ledger. She assigned herself the midnight slot to oversee the first lottery draw under the new system.

An hour later, when the clinic quieted and the lights dimmed to evening mode, she slipped into the observation nook that overlooked the Mirrored Range ravine. Heliora hung low, a tired ember against the darkening sky. She let her forehead rest against the cool glass.

In the silence she heard faint echoes from the Resonance Vigil years before, back when she and Aurelia and Cael were children weaving through the Basin crowds. They had promised each other to protect the people who could not protect themselves. Today felt like living up to that promise.

Elys opened her medical log and recorded the day. She documented every case, every intervention, every moment of pressure from the syndicate. She ended with a note to her fathers: "I held the line. Copper-mote cases stabilized. Algorithm deployed. No lives traded for equipment."

She closed the log, adjusted the copper bracelet one more time, and returned to the ward. Patients slept beneath soft blue lights. The ward monitors hummed in stable rhythms. Outside, the copper motes continued to drift, but inside the clinic, the air carried a different undertone. It sounded like resolve.

Elys took her place beside the triage desk, ready for whatever dawn would bring. The oath lived in her actions, stitched into every breath she helped steady. Tandris still trembled, but tonight the medical corps stood with its citizens, transparent and unbowed.

She whispered to the sleeping ward, "We are not done. Not until every convoy door opens." Then she straightened, checked the timer for the midnight lottery draw, and began preparing fresh bioluminescent cultures. The glow painted her hands in soft teal, a reminder that data and compassion could share the same light.
