# Chapter 2 - Hold the Line

Hot copper dust sifted across the Vorakai simulator bay, the ventilation baffles too slow to seal against the afternoon gust. Cael Varik tasted grit at the back of his throat as the exam scenario flickered into place around him: canyon walls carved from stacked glassleaf blocks, a convoy of evac haulers dead ahead, contact warnings cascading red. He flexed inside the cadet exo harness, feeling the suit respond like an extra layer of muscle. His hands mapped the controls without looking. The first breach drone punched into view, its shell broadcasting false Alliance codes. Cael ignored the script’s suggestion to wait for confirmation. He rolled his stance, snapped a foam charge into the air, and caught the drone at the seam where its wings met the central core. The charge detonated in a puff of white, harmless to the convoy hulls yet strong enough to shred the drone’s improvised rotors.

“Protocol was to hold formation until command authorized fire,” Captain Ryn Kadar said through the overhead speakers. His voice held the gravelly patience of someone who had seen real domes fracture. “You just burned a full point.”

Cael drove the remaining drones back with a rapid two-step rotation, using the suit’s servos to widen his reach. The convoy’s telemetry settled. The scenario logged success, yet the status panel painted the word DEVIATION in stern block letters.

The simulator doors slid open. Dry Vorakai heat shoved inside, smelling of ozone and long-baked steel. Kadar stood on the platform in defense corps slate grey, arms folded. His scarred cheek glinted under the training dome lights.

“Mission secured, casualties zero,” Cael said, unclipping his helmet. Sweat slicked his hair flat. “I call that a win.”

“A win is following the brief and keeping your squad intact.” Kadar gestured toward the holographic playback frozen mid-battle. “What happens when you improvise here and your team assumes the same liberty? I do not need rogue charges when the exodus clock is already misfiring.”

Cael tightened his jaw. “The drones were seconds from breaching. If I had waited for a command loop, we would be patching actual holes instead of debating hypotheticals.”

“You do not decide that alone.” Kadar thumbed the slate on his wrist. “Score is ninety out of one hundred. Competence never excused insubordination. You are carrying your brother’s name into these exams, Varik. Do not dishonor it chasing heroics.”

Heat prickled under Cael’s skin, part anger, part shame, part the relentless Vorakai sun radiating through the training dome glass. He fished the cool edge of his brother’s dog tags from beneath his collar and pressed them against his palm until the metal edge bit. “Understood, Captain.”

Kadar’s expression softened by a fraction. “You were the only cadet to clear every drone. That is why we are having this conversation in private. Remember that discipline is what lets your talent matter.” He tapped his slate again. “Dismissed. Report to Gate Six in thirty minutes. Civil protest is escalating. Cadet squads are reinforcing the barrier while ration shipments reroute.”

The word protest hung heavier than the desert heat. Cael offered a clipped salute and jogged toward the locker bay. He could already hear the distant thrum of crowd noise vibrating through the dome flooring, a low roar like storm wind trapped under glass.

Inside the lockers, the air smelled of solvent and sweat. Cadets shucked training harnesses for field gear. Cael tugged on his riot vest, checked the non-lethal baton slotted at his hip, and clipped fresh resonance beads to his belt. The beads would help the gate lattice read his position and identify friend from foe. He slipped his brother’s dog tags back under the vest, letting the familiar weight settle against his sternum.

“You look like you could pulverize a transport by glaring at it,” squadmate Jorren said from the neighboring locker. His freckled face wore an uneasy grin. “Kadar ride you hard again?”

“He prefers the word coach,” Cael said. The attempt at lightness fell flat even to his ears.

Jorren latched his helmet seals. “Intel says the ration queue stretched past three rings. Loud voices, not much worse. We hold the line and let Council negotiators do their job.”

Cael nodded, though his pulse had already shifted into mission cadence. He had grown up with the mantra drilled into his bones. Hold the line. No excuses. He was not about to falter because civilians shouted.

Vorakai’s Gate Six opened onto the outer desert. During calmer hours the access corridor brimmed with market stalls and spice vendors. Today the stalls were shuttered, fabric awnings tied down tight against the gusts. The sun stood low, casting long amber slashes across the corridor. Ahead, the massive gate lattice shimmered, layers of resonance shielding woven like translucent silk. Beyond it, a sea of people pressed for space. Families clutching ration chits. Miners from the Aeolian flats with dust in their eyelashes. The smell of hunger weighted the air, thin and sour, backed by acrid tang from the protest braziers burning around the perimeter.

Captain Kadar met his squad at the staging platform. A line of defense cadets already flanked the gate, their batons powered but set to stun. Overhead, drones hovered on standby with gravity nets in case the crowd surged.

“Orders are clear,” Kadar said, pacing before them. “Non-lethal force only, graduated response. We keep civilians outside the defense corridor until Council relays the revised ration schedule. You,” he pointed at Cael, “anchor the left flank. You break formation, you forfeit next convoy review. Understood?”

“Understood,” Cael replied. The threat landed heavier than he wanted to admit. Convoy reviews determined which cadets would accompany the Verdentis shipments. Missing one meant losing ground in the race for actual deployment slots.

He took position at the left flank, feet planted on the etched markers in the floor. The resonance lattice thrummed inches from his nose. He could see individual faces now. An elderly woman clutching a child. A trio of Extraction Consortium agitators waving placards demanding Penrose tower access over evacuation hoarding. Cael’s tongue stuck to the roof of his mouth. He wanted to believe the Council’s promise that more ships were coming, that ration cuts were temporary. The crowd’s eyes said they had heard too many promises.

The first wave of protestors slammed palms against the lattice. The barrier flared indigo, dispersing the kinetic impact. Cael lifted his baton to shoulder height, the universal signal that action would escalate if the assault continued. His squad mirrored him in a smooth line. Their training kicked in. Breathe in, settle, absorb the noise.

A supply drone descended behind them, delivering crates of hydration packs and bandages. The gate AI pinged a medical request and directed the drone toward a small figure weaving through the cadet ranks. Elys Kadrin emerged moments later, med-satchel slung across her shoulder, copper braids braided tight against her skull. Her field vest bore the Mirrored Range medical insignia. Her gaze flicked across the line, cool and clinical until it landed on Cael.

“Of course it is you on the flank,” she said. “Try not to break anyone I cannot put back together.”

His jaw reflexively tipped toward a grin. “I could say the same. Try not to let anyone bleed through the lattice.”

Elys’s eyes narrowed. “Jokes do not lower blood pressure.” She knelt to position an auto-doc crate within easy reach. “Command authorized me to station here. I will be triaging civilians who collapse from heat or panic. You will not block them.”

“So long as they are not charging the gate,” Cael said. He kept his gaze forward but listened to her movements. She anchored the crate with magnetic clamps, then snapped on gloves that gleamed in the gate light. Efficient, precise, unflappable. The kind of discipline Kadar always demanded of him.

The crowd’s chant shifted, a surge rolling from the outer rings inward. “Food for all! Open the stores!” Someone lobbed a handful of gravel. It pattered against the lattice, sparking harmlessly. Behind the front ranks he spotted a cluster of figures huddled around a low device, their gestures quick and furtive. The device resembled a squat drum with slender prongs that kept brushing the lattice rhythmically. Each contact sent tremors through the resonance weave, subtle yet wrong. Cael’s spine stiffened. He had studied diagrams of resonance disruptors in training, theoretical weapons banned after the last dome breach. The prongs were designed to find harmonic fault lines and collapse shields from within.

“Captain,” Cael murmured into his comm. “Left flank suspects probable disruptor. Six meters out, center of cluster behind the yellow banner.”

“Hold formation,” Kadar replied immediately. “Riot control drone is moving to your position.”

Cael’s eyes locked on the saboteur. He needed seconds, maybe less, before the disruptor found a frequency seam. Once the lattice dropped, the crowd would pour through, trampling cadets and medical staff alike. Foam charges and gravity nets would only delay the crush.

He watched the saboteur’s hands. They were gloved, movements precise, too confident for a random protestor. The disruptor’s housing glowed faintly. He imagined the tampered schematics Soren had whispered about over encrypted comms three nights ago, proof that Extractor logistics had funded sabotage. This device was their cousin. Cael felt his pulse hammer against his ribs.

“Riot drone is twenty seconds out,” Kadar said. “Do not move from your mark.”

Twenty seconds turned the air to ice. Cael could either obey and hope the drone arrived in time or act. He shifted his weight. Dog tags brushed his chest, a reminder of the brother who had died holding his position on a day very much like this. Cael exhaled once, sharp.

“Varik,” Kadar warned, sensing the motion.

Cael broke formation.

He vaulted the barrier at his back, using the service railing as a pivot. The resonance lattice recognized his beads and parted long enough for him to slip through. The crowd gasped as he landed on the outer walkway. Sand ground under his boots. Hands reached for him, furious or pleading, he could not tell. He ducked beneath the first grab and drove toward the saboteur cluster.

The saboteur looked up, eyes widening. He clutched the disruptor to his chest and spun to run. Cael thrust his baton forward, releasing a pulse that hardened into a translucent wall. The saboteur banged into it, stumbled, and dropped the device. Cael lunged, skidding on the dust, and slammed his palm against the disruptor’s control membrane. The prongs shrieked as he yanked them free one by one. The device’s casing pulsed dangerously, edging toward overload.

He remembered Kadar’s lectures: disruptors stored resonance energy like coiled springs. Improper shutdown risked a sonic burst that could rupture eardrums. Cael adjusted his grip, cycling through the sequences engraved into his memory. Cut power, bleed charge through grounding filaments, vent heat through side ports. The disruptor whined, then fell silent, its core lights dimming to grey.

Hands seized his arms. Two protestors dragged him backward, shouting curses. He twisted free, only to catch a glimpse of the saboteur bolting into the throng. Cael lunged again, but a wall of bodies closed like water. He had already pushed his luck by breaking the line. Chasing deeper would leave his squad exposed.

He hauled the disruptor under one arm and forced a path back toward the gate. A thrown bottle shattered near his head, spraying sticky synth fruit residue down his shoulder. Someone kicked his knee. He staggered, caught himself, and kept moving. Elys appeared on the other side of the lattice, eyes wide.

“Hold still,” she snapped. She triggered the gate’s manual override, creating a narrow aperture. Cael shoved through and collapsed to one knee inside the corridor. Elys was already scanning him with a handheld biosensor. “Pulse spiking. Bruising on your left rib, possible fracture in the knee. You chose this.”

“Disruptor,” Cael said, lifting the device. “They wanted the lattice down.”

Elys’s mouth flattened. She pressed a cool spray against his cheek where the bottle shards had grazed skin. “You left your squad. You left me without cover while I was prepping a heatstroke patient.”

“That patient would be dead if the crowd had poured through.” Cael hissed as she prodded his ribs.

“You do not know that,” she said softly. “You cannot quantify the outcomes you never saw. Plenty of things kill people. Chaos is one. Ego is another.”

Her words hit harder than the thrown bottle. He gritted his teeth and forced himself to his feet. The squad had tightened their formation in his absence. Kadar’s voice cut through the comm channel like a blade. “Varik. Report.”

Cael held up the neutralized disruptor. “Saboteur deployed a resonance disruptor. Device secured. Saboteur escaped. Crowd agitated but contained.”

“Return to position,” Kadar said. The command contained no praise.

Cael limped back to his mark. He ignored the glances from his squadmates and focused on the rhythm of the crowd. The riot drone finally arrived overhead, projecting a low-frequency hum that eased the surge. Negotiators in Council blue stepped forward, voices amplified enough to cut through the chants. Over the next twenty minutes the crowd thinned. Families retreated with promises of staged deliveries. The agitators melted into the alleys.

When the last protestor cleared the approach, Gate Six sealed. The lattice brightened, then faded to its default transparency. Cadets powered down batons. Cael flexed his bruised knee and winced. The adrenaline crash left his hands trembling.

“Inside briefing room two,” Kadar ordered. “Now.”

The squad marched in silence. The briefing room smelled of disinfectant and circulated air, a stark contrast to the grit outside. Kadar stood behind a narrow lectern, slate already displaying the day’s incident log. Elys hovered near the door, arm folded, evidently unwilling to leave before hearing the outcome.

“Gate Six held,” Kadar said. “No fatalities, minimal injuries. That is the headline the Council will see.” His gaze settled on Cael. “However, we record everything. Cadet Varik broke formation despite explicit orders. Cadet Varik intercepted a disruptor, yes, but he also exposed a gap in our line large enough for three protestors to slip through. Fortunately, they chose to drag him rather than rush our med techs. That is not a contingency plan. That is chance.”

Cael bit the inside of his cheek. “If the lattice had fallen—”

“It did not,” Kadar snapped. “Because you guessed correctly about a device. I cannot run a defense grid on guesses. You want to lead squads? Learn to trust the command structure. You are written up for dereliction of formation.”

The words slammed into him harder than any baton. “Sir, with respect, I neutralized a threat that would have—”

“With respect,” Kadar repeated, leaning forward, “you abandoned your station. Council review will consider both facts. Until they do, your application to join the next convoy security review is suspended.”

Cael’s breath caught. “Suspended? Captain, that review determines Verdentis assignments. You know why I need to be there.”

Kadar’s stare softened, the steel giving way to regret. “I do. Which is why this hurts. Hold the line, Varik. Orders exist so the dome does not depend on one person’s instincts. Your brother learned that too late.”

Silence settled. Cael felt the dog tags pressing against his chest, a weight suddenly twice as heavy. He swallowed. “Understood.”

Kadar nodded toward the neutralized disruptor resting on the table. “You did save lives. That is acknowledged. I will submit the device to intelligence. Go to med. Get that knee imaged. Dismissed.”

The squad filed out, eyes averted. Outside the briefing room Elys waited, medical slate in hand. She didn’t smile, yet her voice gentled. “Sit. You are favoring that leg.”

Cael hesitated, pride warring with pain, then let her guide him to a bench near the med alcove. She ran a scanner over his knee, lips thinning at the results. “Microtear in the ligament. Nothing rest and support struts cannot heal.”

“No med stasis?” he asked, attempting humor. It fell flat.

“No. Just you staying off that joint when the docs tell you to.” She taped a support brace around his knee, movements practiced. “You made the choice you believed in.” Her gaze flicked up to meet his. “Next time, warn me before you decide to be courageous. I need to know where to send my triage teams when the line fractures.”

He managed a rough laugh. “You mean you cannot read my mind yet?”

“I am not interested in living inside it,” she said, but the corners of her mouth twitched. She packed her gear and rose. “Report to infirmary in one hour for final clearance. I will log the injury. And Cael? Do not let Kadar’s write-up stop you from sleeping. You will need your strength when the next riot arrives.”

She left before he could respond. Cael stared at the empty corridor for a long moment. The dog tags lay cool against his skin. Kadar’s words echoed alongside Elys’s warning. Orders existed for a reason. So did instincts. The trick would be learning how to braid them together before the exodus clock ran out.

He limped toward the infirmary, the desert sun angling low outside the dome’s translucent panels. Beyond the glass, Vorakai’s dunes shimmered in late light. The city held. The line held. For now.
