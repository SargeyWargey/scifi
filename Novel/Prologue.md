# Prologue — The Basin Oracle

Colors lived behind Aurelia Hesper’s eyelids.

They flickered even when she squeezed them shut against the Vigil crowd pressing into the observation dome—violet pulses that meant the singer stones beneath Selen Basin were healthy, amber smears that meant their harmonics were drifting. Tonight the amber kept widening. The hum of the wind as it scraped the canyon organs thrummed up through the dome’s lattice, braided with the static murmur of thousands of Tandris citizens gathered for the sixth Resonance Vigil.

Maren Hesper crouched in front of her daughter, dark curls pinned back, green lenses misting on the edges. “Rel,” she murmured, careful not to touch Aurelia’s shoulders. “We’re going to start a new strip so the council recorders can see your annotations. Ready?”

Aurelia nodded. The gesture was sharper than it needed to be. Touch was loud. Nodding was quiet.

Maren slid the translucent film into the miniature holo-projector clipped to Aurelia’s wrist. The bead-chain Aurelia used to steady herself clicked against the casing. She focused on the singer stone’s hum outside, not the crush of bodies, not the riot chants thudding against the outer barricades. The Vigil was supposed to be a night of listening. With Heliora’s flux storms growing worse each month, the listening had turned into pleading.

A gust rattled the dome. The hum surged—a new curve within the waveform, a high, sour streak Aurelia had never heard before. It sparked a line of green flame across her mind. She traced it on the film, hand moving in short, precise strokes. Each mark chimed back at her in synesthetic resonance: periwinkle for stable magnetosphere oscillations, orange-red for the deviation that had been growing since last Vigil, sour lime for the latest spike.

Maren held her breath. “That’s three surges in one cycle.”

Aurelia counted primes under her breath to keep her breathing even. Two, three, five, seven. Eleven was sharp as glass. Thirteen smoothed her heartbeat. “It isn’t going back,” she whispered. “Heliora’s new flare isn’t dampening. It’s…stacking.”

“We’ll tell the council.” Maren’s smile was brittle. “Archivist Anhal swore you’d have the floor tonight.”

Aurelia’s gaze slid past her mother toward the observation windows. The glassleaf orchards outside swayed against the storm-light. Beyond them, the defensive cadet yard glowed with training holo-grids. Cael Varik, all elbows and impatient energy at seven years old, dragged his practice spear in looping arcs, barking orders at the younger cadets even during a ritual he clearly found boring. His shaved head gleamed with sweat. He kept glancing toward the barricades where protestors pelted the shield lattice with handfuls of resin pellets, trying to break the Vigil so food riots could spill into the council quarter.

Closer to the infirmary entrance, eight-year-old Elys Kadrin organized a line of coughing citizens into triage zones the way her fathers organized archive shelves—precise, unsentimental. She pressed copper filtration masks into calloused hands and issued instructions in a calm alto that cut through the storm.

And near the maintenance hatch, another small figure sat cross-legged atop a coil of insulated cable. Soren Tal’s hair stuck to his forehead in damp strands as he rewired the dome’s resonance sensors under his father’s watchful eye. He tapped each completed weld twice, listening for the pitch changes. When the tone matched what Aurelia had mapped last year, he exhaled.

Aurelia pressed her palm against the glass. All their scattered lives beating against the same failing rhythm.

The vibrational data array on the center dais flashed yellow. Councilor Vey Aneel, the Extractor bloc’s gravel-voiced matriarch, stepped toward the mic and raised her arms. “Citizens! The Vigil reminds us that Tandris endures. The singer stone hum still holds. We will weather this flare as we have the last six.”

The crowd’s reply was not faith but hunger. “Open the granaries!” someone shouted. “Release the Verdentis schedules!”

Maren shot Aurelia a look that said not yet. They needed the full harmonics plotted before they confronted the council. Aurelia shifted her weight and kept drawing, layering data from the dome instrumentation over the patterns she could feel in her bones.

When the final surge burned neon white behind her eyes, she knew the numbers wouldn’t wait.

“Mama.”

Maren saw the urgency and stiffened. “You’re sure?”

Aurelia held up the strip. “It’s cascading. The magnetosphere will collapse inside nine Tandris years. Verdentis can take the domes. We have to go now.”

Maren had promised never to touch without warning. Tonight she ghosted her fingers close enough for Aurelia to feel warmth. “Then we go tell them, Basin Oracle.”

The nickname scraped across Aurelia’s skin. She wasn’t a prophet. She was a girl who could hear math. But the city had decided she was an omen the night she’d first explained to Anhal what Heliora’s flux storms really meant, so the name clung.

They threaded through the Vigil crowd, keeping to the shadowed edge where space opened around the maintenance conduits. Aurelia kept her gaze on the ground to avoid eye contact. Her bead-chain rattled against her wrist in a steady rhythm—two taps for yes, three for no, four for calm.

Cael’s training squad fell silent as she passed. “There goes the little calculator,” he muttered loud enough for Aurelia to hear. But his eyes, dark and sharp, tracked the riot line with the same worry she knew well.

Elys angled to block Aurelia’s path, thrusting a mask toward Maren. “Air quality’s dipping. Copper motes are off the charts.”

Maren accepted the mask. “Thank you, Doctor-in-training.”

Elys straightened, pride flickering. “Someone has to keep the little kids breathing while the council argues about math.”

Aurelia met her gaze. “The math is the breathing.”

Elys blinked, then nodded once, as if tucking the line away for later.

Soren glanced up from his coils just as Aurelia stepped onto the maglev pad. “I finished the dampener recalibration,” he whispered. “If they shut you out again, use the service lift. I left the panel code on Channel 9.”

Aurelia flicked two fingers in thanks. Gamma wave frequencies pulsed across her skin. She traced them in the air as the lift shot upward.

The council chamber was garden quiet compared to the Vigil hall, its vaulted ceiling inlaid with mirrored shards that refracted Heliora’s light into rainbows. Aurelia preferred the way the panels broke the noise, scattering echoes into manageable whispers.

Circular tiers rose around the central floor. Councilors in layered glassleaf robes, holo-briefs hovering above their palms, muttered among themselves. Extractor delegates in rust-colored suits clustered on one side, Defense Corps officers on another, Gatekeeper archivists in their pale cloaks lined the back wall.

Archivist Sori Anhal stood alone near the dais, a slight woman with silver hair coiled high. She raised a hand in greeting as Aurelia and Maren approached. “Initiate Hesper,” she said softly. “We saved you five minutes. No more. Vey Aneel has already questioned the reliability of a child’s projections.”

“They’re not projections,” Aurelia said. “They’re harmonic facts.”

Anhal’s eyes crinkled. “That’s why we listen.”

Councilor Vey tapped her cane against the stone. “You dragged us from the Vigil for this, Anhal? The Basin Oracle’s bedtime sketches?”

“They’re the best climatological models we have,” Anhal replied. “And she is the reason we caught the last three flux spikes before they cooked Vorakai’s outer dome.”

A ripple of dissent murmured across the chamber. Aurelia steadied her breathing, aligning it with the bead-chain taps. Two-tap inhale, three-tap exhale. She stepped onto the dais.

Heliora’s latest flare painted the ceiling in wary gold. Aurelia placed her translucent strip on the holo-table. Anhal dimmed the lights, and the chamber filled with floating curves, color-coded to the synesthetic palette Aurelia had scribbled on the film. Gasps fluttered around her as the sharp orange band speared through the projection like an approaching blade.

“Tandris’s magnetosphere is collapsing,” Aurelia said. She kept her voice flat. The numbers were the story; anything else added noise. “The singer stones harmonize with the planet’s magnetic field. They’ve shifted twenty-three percent over the last six Vigils. Tonight the primary frequency jumped again.”

She flicked her fingers, drawing the red-orange line upward. “Heliora’s flux storms are intensifying. The solar wind is eroding our shield, not gradually, but exponentially. In nine Tandris years, the collapse will strip the atmosphere from the basin domes unless we dismantle and launch them first. Verdentis’s creation disc can accept our habitats with minimal modification. Its magnetosphere is stabilized by Nyx Meridian’s frame-dragging. If we commit to an exodus this cycle, survivors can transfer with an eighty-one percent success probability.”

Aurelia rotated the model. Verdentis’s orbit—a graceful loop through Nyx Meridian’s emerald halo—hung beside Tandris’s shrinking magnetosphere like a promise and a threat.

Councilor Vey’s lip curled. “And if we wait? If we invest in the Dyson-sphere project our engineers proposed?”

“We don’t have the raw materials,” Aurelia answered. “The Dyson lattice requires fourteen million kilometers of superconducting frame. Tandris’s asteroid reserves can provide seven percent of that—eight if we cannibalize the Penrose towers. The build would take twelve years at full production. We have nine before Heliora cooks the shields. The math refuses the sphere.”

An Extractor in gold-trimmed sleeves slammed his palm on the bench. “Your math isn’t the only consideration. Verdentis isn’t empty. The Enclave has been silent for two cycles. We send our domes there, we risk annihilation by whatever politics they hide under that creation disc.”

“Risk versus certainty,” Aurelia said. Her voice trembled. She forced it back to even. “Heliora’s storms are not negotiating. They will not pause because we debate.”

A Defense officer leaned forward. “Your plan assumes Gatekeeper control over the lottery. Our corps won’t cede security decisions to a five-year-old.”

Aurelia felt her throat tighten. “You don’t have to believe me. Run the numbers yourself. Listen to the stones. Cael Varik’s squad heard the same hum I did tonight.”

The chamber stilled. Cael’s father, Lieutenant Garron Varik, shifted in his seat. Anhal seized the pause. “The lottery remains under council purview, as always. What we need now is authorization to begin disassembly of the peripheral domes and to release Verdentis convoy schematics so our engineers can cross-train.”

Councilor Vey’s nostrils flared. “You are asking us to incite panic based on the intuition of a child whose synesthesia you choose to idolize.”

Aurelia’s beads rattled. “It isn’t intuition. It’s—”

“Enough,” Vey snapped. “We will not hand the destiny of Tandris to bedtime stories.”

Anhal stepped between Vey and the dais. “The Council of Keepers was founded on the premise that data governs policy. Aurelia’s work is the only dataset we have that integrates the singer stone harmonics with Heliora flux telemetry and Verdentis orbital models. Refuse her, and you choose ignorance.”

The chamber erupted—Extractors chanting for energy rights, Gatekeepers reciting clauses from the founding charter, Defense Corps officers signaling to security teams outside. Aurelia covered her ears. The sound scoured her nerves raw.

Maren’s hand hovered beside her cheek, an unvoiced offering of comfort. Aurelia shook her head. She needed more than comfort. She needed the room to listen. The noise made the colors smear, smudging predictions into sludge.

Her gaze snagged on the back wall—on the mural depicting Tandris’s founding. Gold-leafed figures lifting dome struts beneath Heliora’s gentle light. It was beautiful and wrong. The math needed space.

Aurelia seized a grease pencil from Anhal’s satchel and climbed the steps. Councilors shouted. She tuned them out. The mural’s metallic sheen reflected the projections—orange flashes, violet chords. She pressed the pencil to the gold leaf and drew.

She traced Heliora’s flux curve across the sky, then carved Verdentis’s orbit through the center, slicing the idyllic scene with a precise ellipse. She marked the nine-year countdown with stark numerals, added the failure probabilities in angular script, drew the Casimir arrays they would need near Nyx Meridian’s throat. Her small hand moved faster than the objections.

Councilor Vey’s cane cracked against the floor. “Defacement!”

Maren planted herself between Vey and the mural. “Records can be restored,” she said quietly. “Extinction cannot.”

The council chamber’s sound finally fractured into silence. Aurelia lowered the pencil. Her breathing rattled. In the new diagram, Tandris’s domes floated toward Verdentis on trajectories that only just avoided Heliora’s lethal glow. The path looked fragile even to her.

Archivist Anhal touched her own chest, palm flat. “Motion to enter the Hesper Diagram into formal council record.”

“Seconded,” murmured Councilor Dhari, one of the agricultural Keepers. Her hands shook, but she lifted them in the vote.

One by one, Gatekeepers raised their palms. Defense officers hesitated, then added theirs. Finally, with a curse that tasted like surrender, Councilor Vey lifted her cane.

“Fine,” she growled. “Record the child’s apocalypse. Release the preliminary Verdentis schematics under seal. But hear me, Anhal: if this exodus drives Tandris into riot, the blood is on your robes.”

“If we do nothing,” Anhal replied, “there will be no robes left to stain.”

Security escorted Aurelia and Maren through a service corridor to avoid the crowds. The stairwell smelled of ozone and copper dust. Aurelia pressed her ear to the wall. Faint vibrations thrummed through the stone—a distant echo of the singer stones’ lullaby, raw and strained. She wondered if they could feel the decision, if their harmonics shifted because she had inscribed new paths across the council mural.

Outside, the Vigil had dissolved into chaos. News of the council vote had outrun them. Protestors surged toward the barricades, some chanting Aurelia’s nickname in reverent tones, others cursing the “child who would sell Tandris to a black hole.” Food stall owners flung free packets of algae cakes into the crush to keep people from tearing down the dome gates.

Cael Varik’s cadet squad formed a defensive line, wooden practice spears replaced with crowd-control batons. Cael’s jaw clenched as he barked orders, holding the line without striking. He spotted Aurelia in the escort’s shadow and, despite his scowl, dipped his head—a grudging acknowledgment that her warning had become everyone’s reality.

Elys darted between bodies, medkit slung over her shoulder, applying skin-seal patches to those scraped raw by the barricade mesh. Her hair stuck to her cheek; copper motes glittered on her lashes. “Drink,” she commanded a panting elder. “You faint, you get trampled.”

Soren crouched beside a cracked resonance relay, fingers flying as he bypassed the scorched circuit so the Stabilization Hymn could stream through the plaza speakers. The moment the first notes rang out, the crowd’s rhythm changed. The chant faded into a communal hum, the Vigil song steadier now that the path forward—however terrifying—had a name.

Maren leaned close enough for Aurelia to feel her breath. “We need to get you home before the press crews find us.”

“I have to send the data packet to Verdentis,” Aurelia said. “They need to prepare the docking arrays.”

“Anhal will transmit the official version,” Maren soothed.

Aurelia shook her head. “It has to be now. Before the Extractors jam the channel.”

Security hustled them into a shielded tram. As the doors hissed shut, a small hand darted between them. Soren squeezed a resonance bead into Aurelia’s palm. The bead was etched with the Lumea guild’s tidal pattern.

“For the trip,” he whispered. “When we go. To Verdentis.”

The bead was smooth, cool. Aurelia closed her fingers around it. “Bring more drones,” she murmured. “We’ll need patchwork.”

He nodded fiercely.

The tram shot down the conduit toward the Hesper research pod. Aurelia braced her feet against the floor, bead clenched, beads on her wrist clicking in counterpoint. Outside, Heliora’s flare peaked, flooding Tandris’s sky with burnished light that pierced even the tram’s polarized windows.

Maren exhaled shakily. “You were brilliant, Rel.”

Aurelia felt the praise and the terror braided together. “Brilliant isn’t enough,” she said. “We have nine years.”

Maren’s throat bobbed. “Then we use every hour.”

They reached their pod. Inside, holographic resonance maps shone like frozen rain around the compact space. Aurelia slipped free of her shoes, curling toes against the cool flooring. Barefoot, she could feel the subsonic tremors better.

She synced her recorder to the council archive and sent a data burst on a tight-beam channel Anhal had provided, compressing her diagrams into packets aimed at Verdentis’s orbital relay network. She imagined the signal spearing through the void, through Nyx Meridian’s warped gravity, into the creation disc where refugees whispered about legends of the Kerr Gateway. Maybe they would listen. Maybe they would ignore a five-year-old’s warning.

Her message chased the uncertainty anyway.

When the last packet pinged acknowledgment, Aurelia let herself sag onto the floor. The hum of the singer stones seeped through the walls. Tonight, instead of soothing, it sounded like a countdown.

Two, three, five, seven, eleven.

Nine years.

Nine years to learn how to turn color and sound into survival. Nine years to convince a planet to pull itself apart and find a path through a spinning abyss. Nine years to prove that a child’s math could rewrite destiny.

She clutched Soren’s bead and began to map the next set of equations in the air, tracing Verdentis’s orbit, Nyx Meridian’s ergosphere, the Casimir arrays that would cradle the ships. Outside, the Vigil song swelled as Tandris listened to its dying heart.

Aurelia listened with it. And she promised, to the stones, to the numbers, to the people who cursed and praised her name in equal measure: she would not let the hum fade to silence unheeded.
