# Chapter 1 - Glass Domes and Paper Myths

Salt-laden air curled around Soren Tal’s ears in wavering threads, carrying the thin, high keening of an overstrained capacitor with it. The note wobbled half a semitone above the Lumea workbench’s usual baseline hum - a warning pitch only someone who lived inside the maintenance dome’s acoustics would hear. He leaned closer to the thermal grid housing, fingers braced on composite plating still warm from the morning cycle, and breathed out until the tremor steadied. The anomaly hovered there, stubborn and sharp, like the edge of a broken bottle hidden in surf foam.

The archipelago’s tech dome was never truly quiet. Maglev arteries pulsed beneath the grated floor; ion scrubbers sighed in the rafters; outside the reinforced glass, the lagoon slapped a slow rhythm against basalt pylons that kept Lumea’s domes above tide swells. Today the noise layered with the amplified voices of Council auditors assembling on the upper catwalk. Their footsteps rattled down the struts in precise, disapproving cadence. Soren kept his attention on the capacitor’s song and tapped the side panel twice with the butt of his screwdriver, coaxing the note down toward the register that meant safe.

A maintenance drone no larger than Soren’s forearm hovered at his elbow, its six pronged limbs folded like a patient insect. He’d tuned the drone, Kestrel, in the predawn hour, rewriting its routing algorithms to weave through the grid conduits faster than any guild crawler. Now its optical sensor flicked from amber to green in sync with his taps. “Hold steady,” Soren murmured. The drone thrummed back, resonator disk vibrating at 210 hertz. Good. The baseline was intact. The problem sat deeper in the coolant loop, past the panel he was permitted to touch while the auditors watched.

He flexed his fingers to return circulation. The gloves his parents insisted he wear in front of inspectors were too stiff; they cut off the tactile feedback he needed to “hear” the grid with his palms. But Council protocol mandated barriers between apprentice skin and live conduits despite the fact that seasoned engineers worked bare-handed all the time. Soren inhaled the kelp-steeped steam rising from the mug at his feet and let the smell anchor him. Tea pressed warmth into the back of his throat, smoothing the tightness there.

“Inspector Kye is on the platform,” Lyla Tal said under her breath. She stood on the other side of the grid array, her own gloves pristine white, her braid pinned into a circle that signaled guild decorum. Only the tight pinch at the corners of her eyes betrayed strain. “Remember the script. Start with energy efficiency, then redundancy, then tie-in to Archipelago Doctrine.” Her hand hovered, almost touching Soren’s shoulder. At the last second she rotated her wrist and merely adjusted the collar of his work tunic. Touch was a rare luxury in their family too; not because Soren recoiled, the way Aurelia did, but because they’d all learned to keep their gestures measured when auditors were present.

Eren Tal leaned against the railing, thumbs hooked through his tool belt. His expression might have been carved into the dome’s graphene ribs. “We keep it factual, son. No speculation. Not today.” His voice carried the rasp of Lumea saltstorms and too many late-night debates with Council envoys. He had spent the week composing a diplomatic briefing that framed Soren’s upgrade proposal as barely more than preventative maintenance. Incremental, manageable, the language Extractors liked. The truth sat in the hidden schematics Soren had encrypted beneath innocuous filenames, schematics that paralleled Aurelia Hesper’s evacuation math. The upgrades were meant to survive transit, not just Tandris.

Above them, Inspector Danel Kye adjusted the cuff of his black Council coat and peered down with the expression of someone appraising salvage. Two assistants flanked him, slates in hand. The Lumea dome’s translucent roof threw shifting ocean light across their faces, dappling them in gold that did nothing to soften the hard lines. Kye represented the Extractor bloc, those who believed Tandris’s salvation lay in erecting more Penrose towers and squeezing the last erg of energy from Heliora’s flares. He had never set foot in Verdentis’s creation-disc orchards or tasted algae bloom; Soren doubted the inspector could navigate a maintenance duct without a drone to guide him.

Beside Kye stood a spare woman in Gatekeeper blue, Archivist Anhal’s newly assigned envoy. Iryss Pell kept her gaze on the grid, her mouth a thin line. Soren had met her once, when she delivered Aurelia’s latest packet of resonance calculations. She’d traded him a stack of paper pamphlets in return: Extractor propaganda masquerading as public safety notices. Soren had accepted them with polite thanks and scanned every line, cataloguing where the myths contradicted the math. Glass Domes and Paper Myths. The title of today’s inspection had written itself while he annotated the lies.

He slipped his hand into his tool roll and brushed the woven bracelet around his wrist, the Lumea tide pattern Mina had woven before dawn and insisted he wear. Three knots for fidelity, two for courage. His little sister believed in charms more than protocols. Soren believed in tolerances measured to the micrometer. Still, the bracelet’s coarse fibers scratched reassurance into his skin.

“What you are about to witness,” Lyla announced, voice projecting across the dome, “is the calibration pass for Thermal Grid Seven. The upgrade stabilizes peak load variance by nineteen percent using components we reclaimed from decommissioned Penrose scaffolding. Apprentice Tal will demonstrate the cascade and provide documentation.”

Inspector Kye gave a short, humorless laugh. “We’re all very impressed with apprentices these days, it seems. Proceed.”

Soren lifted the service panel. Heat breathed across his face. Beneath the plates, coolant lines shone with frost-flecked condensation; the primary lattice pulsed a slow blue. He let his fingers hover a centimeter above the conduits, listening. The earlier sharp note had subsided into a dull pressure on the edge of hearing. Something within the loop was throttled, as though the flow restriction had been tightened since dawn. He flicked a glance toward his personal slate balanced between tool trays. The diagram glowing there was not the one he had loaded an hour ago.

Someone had overridden his encryption. The schematic on display showed a coolant bypass he had never approved, a deliberate choke point capping throughput at seventy percent. The change wore his authorization stamp.

Soren’s pulse spiked. He masked it by adjusting the lines with his stylus, as though cross-checking output. Sabotage. Subtle, but if the grid overheated under Council observation, the Extractor narrative would write itself: the upgrades were unstable; the guild was reckless; Aurelia’s timeline was impossible. He inhaled until his chest ached, counted primes: two, three, five, seven, eleven, and let the numbers settle his hands.

He tapped the stylus against the slate in a rhythm only Kestrel would interpret. The drone’s optics flashed acknowledgment. “Kestrel, reroute to feeder C, manual override,” he whispered, keeping his mouth hidden behind the panel lip. The drone zipped into the conduit as if merely performing routine diagnostics. Soren angled his body to shield its movement. He could buy himself two minutes, maybe three, before the auditors noticed.

The whining harmonic under his palms tugged him backward through time, to another hum inside another dome. Five years earlier, Selen Basin’s observation deck had shaken with riot chants and wind-driven song when Aurelia Hesper dragged him into the maintenance corridor to show him equations that glowed lavender in her mind. In the aftermath, with the Vigil chaos still echoing, Soren had sat with her on the same insulated coils he now straddled and built a model of her evacuation corridor out of scrap alloy. He remembered the tremble in her breath as she trusted someone else with her math.

He had been six then, wires too large for his fingers, heart pounding as he matched Aurelia’s cadence. She’d hummed prime-number intervals under her breath while he bent alloy strips into concentric rings that would, in theory, cradle Tandris’s domes through Nyx Meridian’s gravity. When the model clicked together, she’d smiled, not the brittle tight-lipped grimace she gave reporters, but a small, astonished curve of mouth. “It will sing differently in vacuum,” she had said. “But you made the shape right.” He had held the model to his ear and heard the faintest hum, a promise of metal learning her math.

Kestrel beeped twice, ready. Soren blinked away the memory. He slid his fingers along the manual release, popped a discrete panel, and exposed feeder C without breaking his scripted cadence. “You’ll note the flow regulators now respond to low-frequency adjustments,” he recited. “By pulsing the resonance at 47 hertz, we coax the coolant to circulate even when Heliora’s flares hammer us simultaneously.”

He pressed his thumb against the manual control and injected a pulse. Kestrel darted in, latched onto the unauthorized choke, and snapped it free. The drone’s chassis shuddered under the strain; Soren bit his cheek to stop himself from flinching. The released coolant surged, and the note he’d been hunting dropped in pitch, settling into a rich, stable tone that vibrated through his ribs. He rode the wave, modulating with micro-adjustments until the array’s indicator lights flowed from amber to crystalline blue.

Inspector Kye cocked his head. “You’re pushing the grid hard for a demonstration, Apprentice Tal. Want to tell me why?”

“Because the grid doesn’t get to choose when Heliora flares,” Soren said before his father could interject. His voice came out steadier than he felt. “We don’t get gentle mornings anymore. We need to prove the dome can swallow the worst of it without losing the agricultural bays. Verdentis’s creation-disc environment is less forgiving than Lumea. We calibrate now, not when we’re already off-world.”

Kye’s mouth tightened. “You see, that right there is speculation. This obsession with Verdentis. With flights of fancy. The Council has not authorized a full exodus. Penrose tower outputs still...”

Envoy Pell cut in smoothly. “The Council has authorized contingency planning, Inspector. The Tal guild is well within remit. Please continue, Apprentice.”

Soren let the coolant flow for another thirty seconds, long enough to collect data that would corroborate his manual logs. He pictured Aurelia in Selen Basin, counting pulses on her forearm: two for yes, three for no, four for calm. He mimicked the pattern against his thigh to steady himself. When he finally closed the panel, the grid purred contentedly. The harsh note was gone.

He presented his slate to Inspector Kye. The data stream scrolled in neat columns, each variance annotated with margin notes in color-coded shorthand. Soren had run simulations through the night, cross-referencing with Aurelia’s latest magnetosphere projections. He’d hidden the boldest extrapolations within what looked like redundant calculations; anyone who bothered to decrypt them would be greeted by his sister’s doodle of a prism kite before the real numbers unfolded.

Kye flipped through the data, uninterested. “You’ve certainly filled the page with impressive digits. Yet energy draw remains steep. Every capacitor you divert to these redundant loops is one less powering Penrose Tower Seven. We can’t indulge every Gatekeeper panic tale I find left on public benches.” He withdrew a crumpled sheet from inside his coat, a copy of the very pamphlet Soren had catalogued. Its headline screamed: VERDENTIS IS VAPOR. “You and your little friend with the beads hand these out. Do you enjoy scaring citizens with your bedtime stories?”

Anger sparked low in Soren’s abdomen. The pamphlets weren’t theirs; Extractor scribes had printed them to discredit Aurelia, calling her predictions myths scribbled on paper scraps. Soren had collected discarded copies to reverse-engineer the ink’s filtration patterns in case they ever needed to trace the print shop. He met Kye’s gaze. “We don’t write those. We fix systems so the citizens breathing Lumea air stay alive long enough to read whatever stories you scatter.”

“Soren,” Eren warned softly. Diplomacy.

Soren exhaled through his nose. “The documentation includes energy reclamation offsets, Inspector. I adapted the Penrose lattice we retired last quarter into phase-change arrays that store surplus heat. The upgrade reduces overall draw by seven percent once in steady-state.”

“Seven percent in best-case models,” Kye countered. “And in the meantime, you’ve risked destabilizing a critical dome days before audit. Speaking of which...” He flicked to another schematic Soren hadn’t meant to share. The unauthorized choke glowed on the display. “Your manual override log shows tampering. Care to explain why your own signature green-lit it?”

Soren’s stomach lurched. He felt Kestrel settle on his shoulder, light as a bead chain. The drone’s casing was smudged with coolant frost, evidence of the emergency fix. “Because someone spoofed my signature,” he said. He kept his tone even, clinical. “The timestamp aligns with the window when Apprentice access is throttled during shift change. The manual override I performed removed it. You saw the result: stable output. If you’d prefer to log a security breach rather than credit the repair, we can submit a joint report.”

Kye’s nostrils flared. “Careful, boy.”

Iryss Pell tapped her slate. “He’s correct about the timestamp. I flagged the log anomaly the moment it propagated to Gatekeeper archives. We traced the request to an Extractor-owned relay.” She turned the screen toward Kye. “Sabotage in the midst of inspection undermines Council confidence more than any Gatekeeper projection does.”

For a heartbeat Soren thought Kye would deny it. Instead, the inspector snapped the pamphlet closed and slipped it back into his coat. “I’ll expect a full investigation. Until then, the guild will not proceed to Phase Two of these upgrades. Council wants testimony before the primary quorum next deepcycle. We’ll hear why you and the Basin Oracle insist on feeding panic.”

The demand hit harder than Soren expected. Testify. Before the full Council. He imagined standing beneath the vaulted chamber murals Aurelia had once chalked over, his voice amplified, every word dissected by factions who saw him as either a prodigy to weaponize or a child to dismiss. He forced his shoulders not to slump. “You’ll have your testimony,” he said. “But you’ll hear the truth about what the grid needs, not the myths you print to keep people compliant.”

Inspector Kye’s mouth curled. “Careful,” he repeated, then spun on his heel and strode toward the exit. His assistants scurried after him, whispers trailing. Envoy Pell lingered, eyes narrowed not at Soren but at the bank of holo-displays lining the dome wall, each cycling through projections of Verdentis’s atmospheric composition. She gave him a single nod, a silent code that the Gatekeepers would back his report.

As the inspectors’ footsteps faded, the ambient hum of the dome returned to its usual layered song. Lyla exhaled a breath she’d been holding for minutes. “You shouldn’t antagonize them.”

“They’re already antagonized,” Soren said, rubbing his thumb over Mina’s bracelet. “They tampered with the grid. If it had failed, hundreds of people would think the upgrades were dangerous. We’d lose months. Maybe the evacuation window Aurelia mapped collapses before we refit everything.”

Eren scrubbed a hand over his jaw. “We’ll isolate the relay and file a complaint. Quietly.”

“Quiet doesn’t work anymore.” The words slipped out before Soren could temper them. He heard the echo of his own voice bounce off the dome, higher than he intended. He lowered it. “Rel’s timeline shows we have four Tandris years before the magnetosphere collapses beyond salvage. Our domes need to be mobile by then. We can’t wait for Council politics to catch up.”

Lyla pinched the bridge of her nose. “And if you burn every bridge, who approves the power allotments we need to finish those retrofits? We’ll testify. We’ll show them the sabotage, the redundancies. But we don’t accuse factions without proof. You’re eleven, Soren. They’ll use that against you.”

He hated the reminder. In the workshop, with the grid’s rumble vibrating in his bones, he felt older, defined by equations and bolts rather than birthdays. Outside, the world kept putting numbers to him in other ways: eleven, child, apprentice. He bent to retrieve his tea, now lukewarm, and swallowed the remainder. The bitterness grounded him. “I never asked to speak for them,” he said softly. “I just want the math to be right. For Rel. For everyone.”

Iryss Pell descended the stairs and met his gaze. “Which is precisely why you should speak. You translate her math into machines. They can’t dismiss that as easily as they dismiss chalk on a council mural.” She glanced at the conduit where Kestrel had banished the choke. “Document everything. I’ll see to it that Archivist Anhal has your schematics before the quorum.”

She swept out, leaving the Tal family amid the faint scent of coolant and the distant crash of waves. The inspection was over. Real work waited in the quiet hours: recalibration, cross-checking for further tampering, preparing testimony that would not distort Aurelia’s models.

By dusk the dome lights dimmed to mimic Tandris’s ember hour. Soren perched on a maintenance gantry overlooking the lagoon, legs dangling, slate balanced on his knees. He replayed the grid diagnostic repeatedly, mapping each spike, each heartbeat in the data. In the corner of the screen, Aurelia’s latest message pulsed in waiting blue.

He tapped it open. Matrices unfolded like waves, annotated with her clipped notes: `Soren: magnetopause collapse projected at 8.7-year mark if southern domes remain fixed. Need your redundancy cascade to keep agricultural bay humidity within tolerance during transit.` Beneath the text, Aurelia had sketched a crude emoticon: two dots and a line, neutral. It was her version of asking: you still on board?

Soren angled his slate to catch the dome light and scribbled back: `Grid Seven stable. Found sabotage. Penrose factions pressing testimony. Will build manual failsafe in your packet.` He hesitated, then added, `We’ll make the math sing.` He sent it before he could second-guess the sentimentality. Aurelia trusted numbers; she also trusted him to keep them honest.

“You look like you swallowed a shard,” Mina said, clambering up the ladder behind him. At seven, she moved with reckless grace, a wiry bundle of energy in a patchwork jumpsuit. She plopped beside him and dangled her feet to match his. The bracelet she’d woven for him, he realized, mirrored the tide pattern sewn onto her sleeve. “Mama says you almost yelled at the inspector.”

“I did yell,” Soren admitted. “Accidentally.”

“Good.” Mina leaned her head against his shoulder. She never asked permission; Soren didn’t mind. “He was awful to the algae harvesters last ration audit. Said their hands were too dirty to touch council pens.” She sniffed. “Papa says we have to be diplomatic, but I think we should just lock him outside the dome during a saltstorm and see how diplomatic he feels.”

Soren laughed, the sound surprising him. The release unclenched something in his chest. “That’s not how diplomacy works.”

“It should be.” Mina peered at his slate, eyes widening at the matrices. “Is that Rel’s math?”

He nodded. “She needs the domes ready to move. We’re running out of time.”

“She always looks like she’s listening to music no one else hears,” Mina said dreamily. “Do you hear it too?”

“I hear the machines,” Soren said. “Maybe it’s the same song.” He closed the slate before Mina could absorb more than patterns. The Council would claim Aurelia indoctrinated children if they could. He stared through the dome shell at the rolling sea, where luminescent plankton painted the waves with ghostly trails. Lumea felt eternal when the water glowed like that, as if the archipelago could outlast any stellar collapse. He knew better. Beneath the shimmer, metal struts creaked under increasing stress each season. He could hear the fatigue in their moans when storms rolled in, a slow dirge that matched Aurelia’s projections.

On the gantry beside him, someone had wedged another pamphlet between railing bolts. The paper was damp, ink bleeding. Soren eased it free. The headline read: GATEKEEPER CHILDREN LIE FOR POWER. Below, crude sketches caricatured Aurelia with hollow eyes and a crown of resonance beads like barbed wire. He tore the pamphlet into thin strips and fed them into the recycling chute. Paper myths disintegrated quick enough when confronted with salt and truth. The lies they seeded took longer to scrub from people’s minds.

“I’m going to find who changed the schematic,” he said. The decision solidified as the strips vanished. “If they do it again during a more volatile cycle, the grid could cascade. People could die because someone wanted a political talking point.”

Mina kicked at the air. “Need help?”

He smiled sideways at her. “Maybe later. Right now I have to read logs. Lots of them. Not exactly thrilling.”

“I can make tea,” Mina offered solemnly. “Kelpsong blend. The one with mint.”

“Deal.” He watched her scamper down the ladder, braid whipping. For a moment the dome felt lighter. Then he stood, slid down the railing, and returned to the workshop.

The maintenance bay emptied after inspection, leaving only low light from the overhead strips and Kestrel’s patient hover near the toolkit. Soren spread log data across three holoscreens, overlaying them with his private encryption. The tampered schematic had routed through three relay nodes before landing in the guild queue. The first two belonged to public infrastructure. The third bore the watermark of the Extraction Consortium’s logistics wing. Proof. He copied the metadata into a secure packet for Iryss Pell.

A stirring in the doorway made him glance up. His father leaned against the frame, expression unreadable. “You handled yourself,” Eren said. “Even if you did it with more fire than we planned.”

“I don’t want to become their weapon,” Soren said. “Or their excuse. I just… I hear the flaws, Papa. They hum at me until I fix them.”

Eren nodded slowly. “Your mother used to say the domes sing. I never believed her until you were born. Now I notice when the song is off-key.” He stepped closer. “Testifying means stepping into the center of a storm. They’ll question you about Rel. Accuse you of collusion. Maybe worse. We can shield you if you’d rather we speak.”

Soren shook his head. “They already think I’m hiding behind you. If I testify, maybe someone who still doubts will listen because I’m the one who rebuilt the grid that keeps their children warm. If Aurelia has to stand in that chamber alone again, they’ll eat her alive.”

A slow, rueful smile tugged at Eren’s mouth. “You’re eleven,” he repeated, but there was pride beneath it now. “All right. We’ll prepare. And we’ll find whoever touched those logs before deepcycle. No one sabotages our work and walks away.”

He left, boots ringing against the polished floor. Soren returned to the holoscreens, the drone’s hum his only companion. The sabotage trail continued beyond the logistics node into a personal access key, one flagged confidential. Soren traced the encryption, fingers flying, until the key resolved into a name: Master Craev Jor, senior engineer assigned to Penrose Tower Seven. He had campaigned against diverting parts to evacuation prep. He had also sat across from Soren during last month’s guild council, eyes full of grandfatherly benevolence as he explained that children didn’t understand resource allocation.

Soren stared at the name until it blurred. He and Craev had once soldered a ventilation patch together while swapping stories about growing up on different domes. The betrayal lodged beneath Soren’s ribs like shrapnel. He saved the file, encrypted it, and shut down the holo array. Proof meant little if he wielded it wrong. Aurelia always reminded him: data without context becomes ammunition for the wrong side.

The workshop quiet tugged him into memory again. After the Vigil, Aurelia had been sequestered in Gatekeeper quarters, flanked by archivists and medics. Soren had slipped past security with a satchel of replacement resonance beads he claimed she needed for calibration. In truth, he’d wanted to make sure she still remembered how to laugh. He found her curled on a cot, fingers tapping prime numbers on her knee. He’d held out one of his prototype drones, a clumsy disk that wobbled when it flew, and confessed he had named it for the prism kites they used to chase atop Lumea windbreaks. She’d taken it without touching his hand, eyes brightening. “If you give it a resonant spine,” she’d murmured, “it won’t wobble.” Together they’d rewired it, soldering in silence. When it finally steadied, she’d said, “Thank you for the bead,” referring to the one he’d squeezed into her palm during the tram escape days earlier. It had taken Soren another year to realize she layered gratitude like that, out of sequence, always precise, never careless.

By age nine, their collaboration had moved to Lumea’s communal classroom. While other apprentices doodled Penrose tower schematics to impress Extractor tutors, Soren and Aurelia built a simulation table out of recycled projector glass. He sketched coolant pathways; she inscribed gravitational corridors overhead, coloring them with scented inks so he could “hear” her logic through smell when the room grew too loud. When the teacher confiscated their table, calling it unrealistic, Aurelia calmly pulled up Council database figures to prove otherwise. The class laughed uneasily. Soren watched her withdraw behind her bead chain, lips pressed thin. Afterward, he took her to the wharf to show her how the maintenance drones tracked tide frequency. She stood on the edge, eyes closed, and whispered the prime sequence into the sea spray until the drones’ hum harmonized with her tapping.

On his tenth birthday, the guild gifted him an unused workspace in the rafters, a corner no one else wanted because salt condensed there and corroded tools. Soren scrubbed the corrosion away, lined the shelves with hand-built instruments, and painted the back wall with color-coded bands marking frequency ranges. Aurelia visited once, leaving behind a roll of transparent film covered in differential equations. “These are the tolerances for Verdentis’s atmosphere regulators,” she told him. “No one else will humor me. Will you?” He’d filed the equations beside his own notes and promised to make the numbers tangible. Today, those same tolerances informed the upgrades he’d performed under Inspector Kye’s stare.

Deepcycle arrived with the soft chime of the dome’s chronometers. The 27.4-hour day stretched longer here; night crept in as a cobalt hush. Soren descended to the family quarters, where Lyla had spread scrolls of council procedures across the kitchen table. The room smelled of seared mussel cakes and solder flux, a strange juxtaposition that felt like home. “We need to decide how much to reveal,” she said without preamble. “If we open with sabotage, they’ll think we’re deflecting. If we open with Aurelia’s timeline, the Extractors will accuse us of collusion. Perhaps begin with the grid’s performance metrics. Facts first.”

Soren slid into a chair, pulling a pad of conductive paper toward him. “Facts don’t breathe unless they connect to the people they protect,” he murmured. He sketched a dome cross-section, highlighted the families living beneath Grid Seven, and annotated how a failure would cascade through humidity regulators, crop yields, and medical bay sterilization. “I’ll talk about the baby in agricultural quadrant three who needs stable humidity to keep his lungs clear. About the elders in the kelp farms. Then I’ll show how the upgrade keeps them alive. After that, I’ll introduce Aurelia’s math.”

Lyla watched him write. Pride and worry warred in her eyes. “You sound older when you do that,” she whispered. “Older than any eleven-year-old should have to be.”

“I don’t feel older,” Soren said. “I still forget to eat when I’m chasing a harmonic. Mina has to leave snacks in my tool drawers.” He smiled faintly. “But the domes don’t care how many years I’ve been alive. They only care if I hear them in time.”

Eren joined them carrying a stack of data rods. “Iryss Pell sent a sealed brief. The Gatekeepers will submit Craev Jor’s access log as evidence if we need leverage. For now, she advises keeping it in reserve.”

Soren’s jaw tightened. “He shouldn’t get to walk free.”

“He won’t.” Eren set the rods down gently. “But we need the Extractor bloc to listen. If we humiliate one of their lead engineers on the floor without context, they’ll circle the wagons. Present the sabotage as a systemic vulnerability. Let the Council believe the real culprit could be anyone unless they give us the authority to audit. Then, when they grant it, we present the proof.”

Politics felt like building a machine out of mirrors and hoping it held together. Soren preferred bolts. Still, he nodded. “I’ll do it.”

Hours later, when his parents slept, Soren crept back to the workshop. The dome’s lighting had shifted to a faint bioluminescent glow, engineered algae casting soft teal patterns across the floor. He set Kestrel on the bench, opened the drone’s casing, and replaced the scratched resonator disk. “You did good today,” he told it. The drone buzzed once, a pleased chirp. He logged the day’s events in his notebook, color-coding each entry: red for sabotage, blue for successful calibration, green for personal notes. In the margins he scribbled: `Rel needs reliable coolant loops.` and `Inspectors rely on paper myths.` He underlined the words twice.

Before he closed the notebook, he added one more line: `Find a way to make them listen without letting them break you.` He wasn’t sure if it was an instruction to himself or a plea. Either way, he folded the page, slid it into the back pocket, and turned off the bench lights.

The next cycle, before Council summons arrived, Soren descended into the supply depot carved beneath the lagoon’s support pylons. Stacks of sealed crates lined the narrow aisles, each stamped with Extractor sigils and inventory numbers. He keyed open crate 47-Delta and revealed a cache of microchannel heat exchangers destined for Penrose Tower maintenance. Officially, he catalogued them. Unofficially, he rerouted four units to a hidden palette marked for Aurelia’s lab in Selen Basin. He justified the transfer in the ledger with a footnote about “unexpected attrition during grid recalibration,” a phrase bland enough to pass review. If the Council insisted on hoarding parts for towers that couldn’t save them, he would move what he could into projects that might.

He hated the deception. His parents would have scolded him if they knew. But in the balance between following rules and safeguarding lives, Soren found his loyalty tipping toward the latter. His conscience stayed quiet as long as the math aligned. He logged the transfer, encrypted a copy for Aurelia, and resealed the crate.

Footsteps echoed from the far end of the depot. Soren ducked behind a column, heart hammering. Master Craev Jor strode past, his once-kind face shadowed. He paused near the crate Soren had opened, consulting his slate. “Missing units,” he muttered. “Again.” His fingers flew as he typed, no doubt filing a complaint. Soren pressed his back against the column and held his breath until Craev moved on. The betrayal flared fresh, yet beneath it lay an ember of sadness. Once, he would have asked Soren to join him on a repair run, calling him “little maestro.” Now he set traps in schematics to make the boy stumble.

When the footsteps faded, Soren emerged. He leaned his forehead against the cool metal of the crate. “We’ll make every piece count,” he whispered, promising it to Aurelia, to Mina, to the workers whose names filled his schematics like ghosts. The promise steadied him. He left the depot with shoulders squared for what awaited.

Three cycles later the Council summons arrived, a translucent holo band projected into the workshop, bearing the seal of the Keepers. It instructed Apprentice Soren Tal to appear at the Selen Basin Council chamber to deliver testimony on grid integrity and projected evacuation timelines. Attached was a travel clearance and a stern reminder of decorum. Soren read it twice, then again, pulse quickening with equal parts dread and purpose. He packed his notebooks, Aurelia’s equations, and Kestrel’s charging dock into a compact satchel. Mina tucked a pouch of kelp tea inside when she thought he wasn’t looking. He left it where she’d placed it; he would need it.

The maglev tram from Lumea to Selen Basin sliced across the archipelago’s lagoon, rising on columns that shimmered with condensation. Soren stood near the forward window, watching as the sea gave way to the canyon’s mirrored flats. Memories of the Vigil washed over him: the riot chants, the way Aurelia had pressed her bead chain against her palm to keep from screaming. He touched his wrist where the bracelet Mina wove rested. Same pattern, same promise. When the tram slowed, the city’s domes rose like glass pearls out of the salt flats, Kanthi towers casting long shadows. Soren breathed in the metallic tang of singer stone harmonics that shivered through the chassis. He was coming back not as a child hiding behind guild elders, but as someone the Council expected to answer for machines he’d designed.

Aurelia met him at the transit airlock, accompanied by Archivist Anhal and two gatekeepers carrying stacks of data tablets. She still tapped prime numbers on her forearm, but the motion was slower now, deliberate. “Your grid held,” she said by way of greeting. Her eyes flicked to his satchel. “Do you have the sabotage logs?”

Soren nodded and passed her a sealed drive. “Craev Jor. He routed it through an Extractor relay.”

Aurelia’s mouth tightened. “Figures.” She glanced toward the Council hall, where muffled arguments throbbed like distant thunder. “They want to paint us as myth-makers. You ready to tell them a story grounded in metal?”

He swallowed. “I wrote it out. The words. So I don’t forget.” He tapped his notebook. “I’m going to start with the people under Grid Seven.”

Aurelia’s expression softened. “Good. They never listen to numbers unless the numbers wear faces.” She reached into her pocket and handed him a fresh strand of resonance beads, the colors shifting between teal and gold. “For the podium,” she said. “You can tap them if your hands shake.”

He looped the beads around his finger, feeling the balanced weight. “Thank you.”

Archivist Anhal cleared her throat. “Remember: speak the truth, no embellishments. Let the saboteurs indict themselves with their own logs. When they accuse you of fearmongering, remind them of today’s temperature drop. They feel it in their own bones.” The Archivist rested a warm hand on Soren’s shoulder, the kind of touch that always preceded difficult tasks. “You’ve rebuilt more in a year than some Councilors do in a lifetime. Trust that.”

Soren’s throat went dry. He nodded. As they approached the chamber doors, the mural Aurelia had chalked during the Vigil loomed overhead, freshly scrubbed yet still ghosted with equations she had written at five years old. Council staff had tried to erase her brilliance; the stone remembered. He inhaled the scent of chalk and old stone, mingled with the copper tang of the riot barriers outside. Through the closed doors came the murmur of hundreds of voices, the heart of Tandris beating irregularly.

He paused with his hand on the bead strand. A ripple of fear threatened to freeze his spine. What if his voice cracked? What if he failed to convince them? He heard the grid’s hum in his memory, the way it had faltered under sabotage, the way it had steadied under his hands. Those notes were truer than any paper myth. He fixed the pattern in his mind, let it vibrate through his bones, and stepped forward as the chamber doors swung open.

As his eyes adjusted, he picked out familiar silhouettes in the gallery benches. Cael Varik in cadet gray, posture rigid; Elys Kadrin beside the med corps delegates, hands folded around a filtration mask; Mina perched illegally on a railing beside Maren Hesper, face fierce. Their presence stitched him to the moment, to the network of lives the Council liked to call statistics. Soren squared his shoulders and let their trust settle over him like a shield.

The light beyond was blinding at first. Councilors in formal robes turned, whispers rising. Soren lifted his chin, the resonance beads warm against his palm. He wasn’t walking in for himself. He walked in for the engineers bent over failing grids, for the children breathing recycled air, for the girl who heard magnetospheres in color chords. “Glass domes and paper myths,” he murmured under his breath. “We’ll show them which one holds.” He drew a breath tasting of copper motes and kelp tea ghosts and stepped toward the speaking dais as the Council herald announced his name. The dome’s hum followed him, loyal as ever. Whatever myths the Extractors clung to would have to withstand the clear, resonant truth of a child who built futures out of glass and steel.
