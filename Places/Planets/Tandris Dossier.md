# Tandris Dossier

## 1. Stellar Context
- **Planet Name:** Tandris, third world of the Heliora system.
- **Star Name:** Heliora, a stable G-type main-sequence star slightly warmer than Sol.
- **Orbital Position:** Receives 1.15× Earth's solar flux.
- **Day Length:** 27.4 standard hours, producing long golden sunrises and sunsets.
- **Year Length:** 364 local days; seasons are modest but pronounced.

## 2. Planetary Profile
- **Diameter:** 1.08× Earth's, granting 1.05g surface gravity—comfortably familiar yet subtly heavier.
- **Atmosphere:** Nitrogen-oxygen mix with faint coppery motes that scatter light into peach and teal hues. Air tastes mineral-rich, with a brisk metallic tang near industrial domes.
- **Sky Palette:** Day skies range from pale turquoise to deep cerulean; dusk ignites crimson undersides of high cirrus bands, while a persistent auroral ribbon flickers near the poles.
- **Weather Systems:** Vast, slow-moving storm cells form over the inland seas. Rain smells faintly of ozone and petrichor blended with a sweet resin exuded by native flora.

## 3. Surface Geography
- **Continents:** Three primary landmasses—Tandris (temperate heartland), Vorakai (arid equatorial plateau), and Lumea (archipelagic chain of volcanic isles).
- **Hydrology:** Shallow sapphire seas dotted with bioluminescent plankton. Rivers carve stepped canyons, revealing strata of iridescent minerals nicknamed "singer stone" for their harmonic hum in high winds.
- **Landmarks:**
  - **Selen Basin:** A massive concave salt flat shimmering with mirrored pools, harvest site for rare conductive salts.
  - **Mirrored Range:** Mountain chain capped with silicate crystals that refract sunlight into a perpetual halo.
  - **Aeolian Flats:** Wind-sculpted dunes that resonate at specific frequencies, used by settlers for acoustic navigation during dust storms.

## 4. Biosphere Snapshot
- **Flora:** Dominated by glassleaf succulents whose translucent fronds store water and glow faintly at night, and towering hollow "breath trees" that fold open at dawn to release oxygen-rich mist.
- **Fauna:** Agile six-limbed grazers called **vellon** roam in herds, while skyborne **prism kites**—semi-translucent avians—navigate with internal bioluminescence. Predators include the **shadeshift**: chameleon-like felines with refractive fur.
- **Microecology:** Soil microbes produce mineral filaments, granting topsoil a faint sheen. Settlers cultivate symbiotic fungal mats that reinforce dome foundations.

## 5. Settlements & Domes
- **Primary Habitat Type:** Interconnected geodesic domes with modular nodes. Outer shells are layered composite: mirrored ceramic for radiation deflection, beneath which lies a flexible graphene mesh.
- **Environmental Controls:** Each dome maintains distinct climate profiles—lush humidity in agricultural bays, crisp sterility in research spires. Venting towers emit soft violet light at night as ion scrubbers cycle.
- **Transit:** Elevated maglev conduits link domes, threading through airlock gates. Beneath the surface, maintenance tunnels hum with autonomous crawler drones.
- **Aesthetic Notes:** Interior streets are lined with luminescent moss and kinetic sculptures that respond to pedestrian movement. Windows project augmented vistas overlaying real-time biosphere data.

## 6. Culture & Society
- **Population Mix:** Descendants of multi-world colonists; cultural identity blends pragmatic survivalism with artistic reverence for the landscape's light phenomena.
- **Governance:** Council of Keepers—specialists representing ecology, engineering, culture, and defense. Decisions require consensus, reflecting the delicate balance with the planet.
- **Daily Rhythm:** Extended daylight shifts encourage 3-phase work cycles. Communal meals occur during "ember hour," when domes dim to mimic sunset hues and share oral histories.
- **Traditions:** The **Resonance Vigil**—citizens gather at dome perimeters during seasonal windstorms to listen and record the planet's natural harmonics. **Glassleaf Weaving** uses harvested succulent fibers to craft ceremonial garments that glow softly.

## 7. Technology & Infrastructure
- **Energy Grid:** Hybrid solar-thermal towers and subsurface geothermal taps. Energy surplus stored in crystalline capacitors etched with microchannels.
- **Water Management:** Atmospheric harvesters condense moisture at dawn; aqua-domes recycle greywater through biofilters colonized by engineered algae.
- **Defense Systems:** Low-profile rail emplacements camouflaged within dune ridges; drone sentries patrol using thermal and acoustic sensors. Planetary shield lattice engaged during meteor showers.
- **Research Focus:** Atmospheric chemistry, domed agronomy, and harmonic geology—studies of how sound frequencies affect mineral growth.

## 8. Sensory Impression Guide
- **Sight:** Shimmering horizons, prismatic reflections off dome shells, interior bioluminescent accents mapping pedestrian flow.
- **Sound:** Soft thrumming of climate regulators, distant whistle of wind over canyon organ pipes, melodic chimes triggered by resonance sensors embedded in plazas.
- **Smell:** Crisp ionized air, sweet-spicy scent of glassleaf nectar in agricultural zones, earthy musk of fungal reinforcement mats in industrial sectors.
- **Touch:** Slight static cling from charged air, fine dust that leaves shimmering residue, warm ceramic surfaces radiating stored solar heat.
- **Taste:** Fresh produce infused with mineral-rich water, beverages brewed from breath tree sap carrying a cooling, menthol-like finish.

## 9. Narrative Hooks & Points of Consistency
- **Resource Tension:** Demand for singer stone crystals risks destabilizing canyon walls; Keepers debate expanding harvest zones.
- **Climate Extremes:** Rare supercell storms can overwhelm dome shields, forcing emergency evacuations to subterranean bunkers.
- **Cultural Conflict:** Younger generations push for open-air settlements, challenging elders' caution. Fringe groups experiment with bio-adaptive skin grafts to survive outside domes.
- **External Relations:** Rumors of off-world corporations seeking mining rights create political friction. Diplomatic delegations hosted in neutral transit domes featuring curated biomes.
- **Mystery Element:** Anomalous auroral flares align with deep seismic pulses beneath Mirrored Range—possible signs of an ancient sub-crustal energy network.

## 10. Key Visual Inspirations for Reference
- **Dome Layout:** Interlaced clusters with multi-level terraces and vehicle staging pads echoing the provided concept art.
- **Surface Palette:** Warm rust and ocher terrain contrasted against gleaming white-silver superstructures and teal atmospheric lighting.
- **Cultural Spaces:** Public plazas domed with transparent panels showcasing starfields, dotted with art installations powered by kinetic energy from foot traffic.
